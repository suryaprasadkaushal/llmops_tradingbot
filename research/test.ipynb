Cimetrix \\nCIMConnect, Cimetrix CIM300, and Cimetrix CIMPortal Plus are in tegrated with Cimetrix CCF to support the \\nSEMI GEM, GEM300, and E DA/Interface A standards.  \\nServices \\nOur services are almost always s old together with, or to suppor t, our products and include the following: \\nSoftware-as-a-Service –  We provide services to make our  Exensio software available to our customers via the Internet, \\ngenerally hosted by third-party providers. SaaS is considered p art of cloud computing since the software is hosted on the \\nInternet, or the “cloud.” Since  our SaaS applications are acces sed from a remote server rather than installed on individual \\nmachines, it is easier to maintain. For example, when the remot e software is updated, the customer’s interface is also \\nupdated for all users. Cloud computing is designed to eliminate  incompatibilities between differ ent software versions and \\nallow us to make incremental updates without requiring software  downloads. Additionally, our customers can save data to \\na central online location, which is designed to allow increased  project collaboration. As part of these services, we also \\ntypically provide hosted management services for the software a nd the customer’s data stored in our cloud. These services \\ninclude environment set-up and configuration, system health mon itoring, data integration maintenance, integration \\nmonitoring, system updates, security, and data upload/download,  and license administration. \\nSoftware Related Services  – We provide software maintenance and support (“M&S”), data ma nagement services, \\nvarious value-added services (“VAS”) to install, configure, or create analysis templates, and other professional services to \\nachieve customers’ specific outcomes using our software. We cal l this last type of services our solutions offering and, in \\nthese cases, we tailor the use of  one or more Exensio products to achieve a desired result. For example, our AIM \\nYieldAware™ FDC solution offering is designed to identify the p rocess control variables that have the greatest impact on \\nproduct yield through professional services that analyze the da ta from both Exensio Proce ss Control and elements of \\nExensio Manufacturing Analytics and make recommendations for th e customer to implement. VAS are provided by our \\nprofessional service personnel w ith expertise that enhances and  complements the engineering teams at our customers. For \\nexample, VAS includes our data cleaning and monitoring services . One requirement of big data analytics is to have clean, \\nharmonized data to analyze. This service offering outsources th e data wrangling and management effort to free the \\ncustomer to focus their efforts on analysis, which has a greate r ROI to the company than data management. \\nCharacterization Services  – These services are designed to characterize key product and/ or process elements, \\nprimarily into CV test structures  or DFI on-chip measurement in struments, and typically do not include performance ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n11 incentives based on the customers’ yield achievement. We provid e these services, typically together with all elements of \\nour CV system, to foundry customers in connection with new proc ess technology development and/or yield ramp. In \\nCharacterization engagements, we generally provide the analysis  of our CV test chips and provide summary findings and \\nrecommendations to the customer. Characterization engagements c an include DFI systems. \\nCustomers \\nOur existing customers include f oundries, IDMs, fabless semicon ductor design companies, OSATs, equipment \\nmanufacturers, EMS, and ODMs, including those that embed and di stribute our Assembly Operations modules in their \\nequipment. Our semiconductor customers’ targeted product segmen ts vary significantly, including microprocessors, \\nmemory, graphics, image sensor solutions, and communications. W e believe that the adoption of our solutions by such \\ncompanies for usage in a wide range of products validates the a pplication of our solutions to the broader semiconductor \\nmarket. We often have multiple contracts with a single customer  or customer group, with no in terdependent performance \\nobligations. In general, our customer contracts are non-cancell able. \\nOne customer accounted for 35% of  our revenues for 2023, two cu stomers accounted for 41% of our revenues for \\n2022 and two customers accounted for 27% of our revenues for 20 21. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of \\nour revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Also, two customers accoun ted for 50% of our gross accounts receivable as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, and three cust omers accounted for 53% of our  gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. \\nWe generally do not require collateral or other security to sup port accounts receivable. See the discussion in “Risk Factors” \\nunder Item 1A for more information about risks associated with customer concentration and contractual provisions. \\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 44%, 50% and  55% of our total revenues for 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. We base these calculations on the geographi c location of where the work is performed or where the \\ncustomer is located. Revenues from customers by geographic area  based on the location of the customers’ work sites for \\nthe last three fiscal years can be  found in Note 11, “Customer and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial \\nstatements. Additional discussion  regarding the risks associate d with international operations can be found under Item 1A, \\n“Risk Factors”. \\nSee our “Notes to Consolidated F inancial Statements”, included under Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data” for additional geographic information. \\nSales and Marketing \\nOur sales strategy is primarily  to pursue targeted accounts thr ough a combination of our direct sales force, our service \\nteams, and strategic alliances. After we are engaged by a custo mer and early in the services p rocess, our engineers seek to \\nestablish relationships in the organization and gain an underst anding of our customers’ business issues. Our direct sales \\nand service teams combine their efforts to deepen our customer relationships by expanding our penetration across \\ncustomers’ products, processes, and technologies. This close wo rking relationship with each customer has the added \\nbenefit of helping us to identify new product areas and technol ogies in which we should next focus our research and \\ndevelopment efforts. From time-to -time, we use sales representa tives/agents in various locations to augment direct sales \\nin certain territories.  \\nWe expect to continue to establish strategic alliances with pro cess licensors, vendors in the electronic design \\nautomation software, capital equipment for IC production, and t est silicon IP and mask-making s oftware segmen ts to create \\nand take advantage of sales channel and co-marketing opportunit ies. Additionally, we expect to form relationships with \\nkey value chain participants, including foundries and OSATs, to  provide services and value across the manufacturing \\nsupply chain. \\nResearch and Development \\nOur research and development focuses on developing and introduc ing new proprietary technologies for our \\ncomprehensive platform, including our Exensio software, Cimetri x connectivity and control products, and DFI and CV \\nsystems, as well as other software products and enhancements to  our existing solutions, such as field applications for DFI ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n12 and CV and new applications targeted to inter-operate with stra tegic partner products. We use a rapid-prototyping \\nparadigm in the context of the customer engagement to achieve t hese goals. We have made, and expect to continue to \\nmake, substantial investments in research and development. The complexity of our technologies requires expertise in \\nstandards, physical IC design and layout, transistor design and  semiconductor physics, semiconductor process integration, \\nnumerical algorithms, e-beam tech nology, hardware, statistics a nd software development. We believe that our team of \\nengineers will continue to advance our market and technological  leadership. We conduct in-house training for our \\nengineers in certain technical ar eas. Our training also extends  to focusing on ways to enhance customer service skills. \\nAlthough it fluctuates, we can have up to one quarter of our re search and development engineers assigned to one or more \\nprojects, partnered with solutio n services engineers, in a deli berate strategy to provide direct feedback between technology \\ndevelopment and customer needs. We also utilize a variety of sk illed independent contractors for specialized development. \\nCompetition \\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, \\nevolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing p rices. We expect market competition to continue to develop \\nand increase as the market for data and analytics continues to evolve. We believe IC companies benefit from a combination \\nof big data management infrastructure, AI/ML-based analytics en gines, and products that generate and collect \\ndifferentiated data that enrich the analytics process. Currentl y, we are a leading provider o f comprehensive commercial \\nhardware, software and IP solutions for optimizing and improvin g design, manufacturing and test operations processes \\nthrough the application of differentiated data and advanced ana lytics. As a result, we face c ompetition from three primary \\ngroups: internal customer development or design programs, equip ment solutions providers, and providers of analytical and \\ndesign software. We face indir ect competition from internal gro ups at IC companies that offer tools with varying degrees \\nof optimization to accelerate pr ocess-design integration or tes t operations. Some providers of semiconductor \\nmanufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design  automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their \\nproduct offerings and compete with us. In addition, companies p roviding general ML and analytics software may focus on \\nsemiconductor companies and comp ete with us. In each of the mar ket segments we compete in, we face competition from \\nestablished and potential competitors, some of whom may have gr eater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing \\nand marketing resources than we have. \\nWe currently face indirect compe tition from the i nternal groups  at IC companies and direct competition from providers \\nof (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA Corporation (“KLA”), Siemens AG (“Siemens”), Onto \\nInnovation, Inc. (“Onto”), and Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”); (ii ) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied \\nMaterials, Inc (“Applied Materials”), Synopsys, Invantest, Inc. , Emerson Electric Co., Onto,  and Siemens; (iii) inline \\ninspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as ASML Holding N.V. (“ASML”), Applied Materials, \\nKLA, and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity so ftware or integration products/services supporting factory \\nequipment connectivity or control needs of customers, such as P E E R  G r o u p ,  I n c . ,  K o n t r o n  A I S ,  G m b H ,  Y o k o g a w a  \\nElectric Corp., Advantest, and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There  may be other providers of competitive commercial \\nsolutions of which we are not aware, and we may compete with th e products or offerings of these named companies or \\nadditional companies if we expa nd our offerings through acquisi tions or development. For example, since our acquisition \\nof Cimetrix in late 2020, we now face competition in the produc ts/services supporting the connectivity, control and \\nintegration of factory equipment. The demand for solutions that  address the need for better integration between the silicon \\ndesign and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competi tors to enter our market. For example, in 2020, two of \\nour competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys acqu ired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, and each \\nhas increased marketing or pricing competition with us. For exa mple, in 2023, Emerson Electric Co. acquired NI, Inc. This \\ncompetition in our market may intensify in the future, which co uld lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting \\nour revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strat egy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose \\nto develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we a re slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet \\nmarket needs. These and other competitors may be able to operat e  w i t h  a  l o w e r  c o s t  s t r u c t u r e  t h a n  o u r  e n g i n e e r i n g  \\norganization, which would give any such competitor’s products a  competitive advantage over our solutions. \\nWe believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to  competition because we have demonstrated results \\nand reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innov ative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new \\ntechnology and product generations. See the discussions in “Ris k Factors” under Item 1A for more information about risks \\nassociated with our competition.

Further, our Nominatin g and Corporate Governance Com mittee is tasked with primary oversight for governance \\nand ESG issues. \\nTalent Development \\nWe are committed to the development and growth of our employees  because we believe this is crucial for our long-\\nterm success. This includes offering training, mentorship, and other development opportunities to further enhance the \\ntalent we have today, but also entails having the right skill s ets for our future. \\nTo this end, we are working to implement a planned set of actio ns around increasing formal programs to achieve these \\ngoals. We believe that our team o f engineers will continue to a dvance our market and technol ogical leadership. We conduct \\nin-house training for our engin eers in certain technical areas.  \\nWe also fund attendance at continuing education courses, sympos ia, and participation in professional organizations. \\nEmployee Engagement \\nEmployee engagement is crucial for the overall health of the or ganization. In 2023, we conducted a survey of all our \\nemployees to assess overall employee engagement. \\nIn addition to our efforts to address employee engagement, we a re committed to supporting our employees and \\ncreating an engaged workforce by  prioritizing the items below: \\n• personal growth through training and development; \\n• recognizing and rewarding our peo ple for their commitment to ou r values and our organization; \\n• flexible work locations and schedules; and \\n• providing a sense of organizational community by hosting online  as well as in-person events where our people \\ncan gather and connect.

Risk Factors \\nA description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. Some of th ese risks are highlighted in \\nthe following discussion, and in M anagement’s Discussion and An alysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \\nLegal Proceedings, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures  About Market Risk. The occurrence of any of these risks \\nor additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially  \\nand adversely affect our business, operating results, financial  condition, and stock price. These risks and uncertainties \\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially from the re sults contemplated by the forward-looking statements \\ncontained in this report. Investors should carefully consider a ll relevant risks and uncertainties before investing in our \\ncommon stock. \\nRisk Factors Summary \\nRisks Associated with Our Business \\n• We have invested significant resources into research and develo pment of our DFI system and Exensio software \\nand if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives on t he expected timeline or at all, our business, financial \\ncondition, or results of operati ons could be adversely impacted . \\n• Our sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering int o contracts or decide not to adopt our products or \\nsolutions after we have performed services or supported their e valuation of our technology, which could result in \\ndelays in recognizing revenue and could negatively impact our r esults of operations in a quarter or result in lower \\nrevenue than we expected if a contract is not consummated. \\n• We rely on sole-source providers for certain software as well a s for specialized parts for our eProbe hardware and \\nsupply-chain delays or disrupti ons could increase our costs or impact our ability to provide complete software \\nsolutions or to build additional hardware tools or meet custome r expectations or deadlines, which could result in \\nlost sales and lower earnings. \\n• Our fixed-fee services for product or system installations/conf igurations may take longer than budgeted, which \\ncould slow our revenue recognition and may result in a lost con tract or a claim of breach by our customers, which \\nwould negatively affect our fin ancial and operating results. \\n• Our ability to sell our products , systems, and solutions depend s in part on the quality of our support and services \\nofferings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and se rvices could negatively affect our sales and results \\nof operations. \\n• Defects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software tools, and failure to effectively remedy any such \\ndefects could decrease our revenue and our competitive market s hare. \\n• Objectionable disclosure of our customers’ confidential informa tion or our failure to comply with our customers’ \\nsecurity rules, including for those related to SaaS access, AI use, or our on-site access, could result in costly \\nlitigation, cause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-going business with existing \\ncustomers. \\n• We generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limite d number of customers, and a large percentage of \\nour revenues from one customer, so defaults or decreased busine ss with, or the loss of, any one of these customers, \\nor pricing pressure, or customer consolidation could significan tly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively \\nimpact results o f operations. \\n• If we do not continuously meet our development milestones of ke y research and development projects or \\nsuccessfully commercialize our DFI system, our future market op portunity and revenues will suffer, and our costs \\nmay not be recouped.

New competitors , technological advances in th e semiconductor industry \\nor other competitive factors may require us to further invest s ignificantly greater resources t han we anticipate. If we invest  \\nsignificantly greater resources  than anticipated without a corr esponding increase in revenue, our operating results could \\ndecline. The technologies and products that we invest in may no t result in products that creat e additional revenue, and we ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n19 may not recoup our investments, which could cause our results t o suffer. If our DFI system and Exensio software do not \\nanticipate technological changes i n our industry or fail to mee t market demand, we may not capture the market share we \\nanticipate, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition \\nor results of operations could be adversely affected. Additiona lly, our periodic research and development expenses may \\nbe independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. \\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering into contracts or decide no t to adopt our products or \\nsolutions after we have performed services  or supported their evaluation of our technology, which could result in delays \\nin recognizing revenue and could negatively impact our results  of operations in a quarter or result in lower revenue \\nthan we expected if a cont ract is not consummated. \\nOn-going negotiations and evaluation projects for new products,  with new customers or in new markets may not result \\nin significant revenues for us if  we are unable to close new en gagements on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner, or \\nat all. Unexpected delays in our sales cycle could cause our re venues to fall short of expectations. Further, the timing and \\nlength of negotiations required to enter into agreements with o ur customers and the enforcement of our complex contractual \\nprovisions is difficult to predi ct. If we do not successfully n egotiate certain key complex contractual provisions, if there \\nare disputes regarding such provisions, or if they are not enfo rceable as we intended, our revenues and results of operations \\nwould suffer. Further, our customers sometimes delay starting n egotiations until they begin developing a new process, \\nhave a need for a new product, or  experience specific yield iss ues. This means that, on occasion we have, and may continue \\nto provide technology and services under preliminary documentat ion before executing the final contract. In these cases, \\nwe would not recognize revenue and may defer associated costs u ntil execution of a final contract, which, if significant, \\ncould negatively impact our results of operations in the period s before we execute a final contract. Further, if we were to \\nincur significant costs and then fail to enter into a final con tract, we would have to write-off such deferred costs in the \\nperiod in which the negotiations ended, which would increase ou r costs and expenses and could result in significant \\noperating losses. \\nWe rely on sole-source providers for certain software as well as for specialized parts for our eProbe hardware and \\nsupply-chain delays or disruptions could increase our costs or impact our ability to provide complete software solutions \\nor to build additional hardware tools or meet customer exp ectations or deadlines, which could result in lost sales and \\nlower earnings. \\nWe provide some enabling technology under license and support f rom sole-source providers and some of our vendors \\nprovide highly specialized, differentiated products and service s related to our eProbe system. In the event these licensors \\nor vendors delay or discontinue providing such products and ser vices to us, it may be difficult and costly or impossible for \\nus to replace such suppliers or parts. In the case of licensed software, this could impact our ability to grow our sales or to  \\nmeet the support expectations of our customers and we may need to resort to legal action, which could limit our future \\nsales, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and harm our ea rnings. For example, in November 2023, a provider of \\nenabling technology abruptly stopped providing maintenance and support of their software product to us. As a result, we \\nresorted to legal action, which caused us to incur increased le gal expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. The \\nmatter is ongoing, and the long-term impact of this provider’s actions on our business and our customers is unknown at \\nthis time. In the case of vendors related to our eProbe tool, s uch disruptions or delays could delay or stop our ability to \\ncomplete and deliver our DFI systems as currently designed to o ur customers, which would negatively impact our bookings \\nand revenue related to such systems. In addition, such delays o r disruptions to our supply chain could significantly increase \\nour component costs, or personnel-related costs if we need to b uild a replacement solution in the case of certain software \\nelements, and could impact our ability to build future generati ons or models of our eProbe tools, any of which would \\ndecrease or delay our sales, earn ings, and liquidity and could otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased  \\ncosts. Such a delay or disruptio n could occur as a result of an y number of events, including, but not limited to: failure to \\ncomply with existing contracts, higher priority alternative buy ers, inflation and global interest rates increasing component \\ncosts, a closure or slowdown at our suppliers’ plants or shippi ng delays including, for example, those made to combat the \\nspread of COVID  -  19, market shortages for critical components, increases in pric es, the imposition of r egulations, quotas, \\nembargoes or tariffs on components or our products, labor stopp ages or shortages, our suppliers’ supply chain disruptions, \\nthird-party interference, cybera ttacks, severe weather conditio ns including the adverse effects of climate change-related \\nevents, geopolitical developments,  war or terrorism, and disrup tions in utilities and other services. In addition, the ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n20 development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the f uture may increase the complexity of supply chain \\nmanagement. Failure to effectively manage our supply of compone nts and products could advers ely affect our business. \\nOur fixed-fee services for product or system installations/configurations may take longer than budgeted, which \\ncould slow our revenue recognition and may result in a lost contract or a claim of breach by our customers, which \\nwould negatively affect our financial and operating results. \\nOur fixed-fee services, includin g for Characterization, require  a team of engineers to collaborate with our customers \\nto address complex issues by using our software and other techn ologies, and the installation and configuration of our \\nsoftware into our customers’ fabrication and test/assembly faci lities requires experienced engineers working with our \\ncustomers on active foundry and test/assembly equipment. We mus t accurately estimate the am ount of time and resources \\nneeded to complete these types of services to determine when th e engineers will be able to commence their next \\nengagement. In addition, our accounting for contracts with such  services, which generate fixed fees, sometimes requires \\nadjustments to profit and loss ba sed on revised estimates durin g the performance of the contract. These adjustments may \\nhave a material effect on our results of operations in the peri od in which they are made. The e stimates giving rise to these \\nrisks, which are inherent in fixed-price contracts, include the  forecasting of costs and schedules, and contract revenues \\nrelated to contract performance. If we fail to meet a customer’ s expectations, the customer could terminate their contract \\nwith us or claim that we breache d our obligations, which could negatively affect our financial and operating results. \\nOur ability to sell our products, systems, and solutions depe nds in part on the quality of our support and services \\nofferings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and services could negatively aff ect our sales and results of \\noperations. \\nOnce our products are integrated  within our customers’ hardware  and software systems, our customers may depend \\non our support organization to resolve any issues relating to o ur products. Further, in connection with delivering our SaaS \\nServices, which requires us to maintain adequate server hardwar e and internet infrastructure, including system \\nredundancies, we are required to meet contractual uptime obliga tions. A high level of system and support is critical for the \\nsuccessful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not eff ectively provide subscription access to our SaaS customers, \\nassist our customers in deployi ng our products, succeed in help ing our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, \\nand provide effective on-going support and the privacy and data  security capabilities required by our customers, we may \\nface contractual penalties or customers may not renew subscript ions or services in the future, which would negatively \\nimpact our results of operations. In addition, due to our inter national operations, our system and support organization faces \\nchallenges associated with deliv ering support, hours that suppo rt is available, training, and documentation where the user’s \\nnative language may not be English. If we fail to maintain high -quality support and services or fail to adequately address \\nour customers’ support needs, our customers may choose our comp etitors’ products instead of ours in the future, which \\nwould negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.  \\nDefects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software  tools, and failure to effec tively remedy any such defects \\ncould decrease our revenue and our competitive market share. \\nIf the software, hardware, or proprietary tech nologies we provi de to customers contain def ects that negatively impact \\ncustomers’ ability to use our syst ems or software,  increase our  customers’ cost of goods sold or time-to-market, or damage \\nour customers’ property, such defects could significantly decre ase the market acceptance of our products and services or \\ncould result in warranty or other claims. We must adequately tr ain our new personnel, especially our customer service and \\ntechnical support personnel, to effectively and accurately, res pond to and support our customers. If we fail to do this, it \\ncould lead to dissatisfaction among our customers, which could slow our growth. Further, th e cost of support resources \\nrequired to remedy any defects in our technologies, hardware, o r software tools could exceed our expectations. We have \\nand may further incorporate AI solutions and related technologi es for use in product development, or into our platform, \\nofferings, services and features, and these applications may be come important in our operati ons over time. If the content, \\nanalyses, recommendations, or o ther output that AI applications  assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, \\ninaccurate, or imprecise, our bu siness, financial condition, an d results of operations may be adversely affected. Any actual \\nor perceived defects with our sof tware, hardware, or proprietar y technologies may also hinder our ability to attract or retain  \\nindustry partners or customers , leading to a decrease in our re venue. These defects are frequently found during the period \\nfollowing introduction of new sof tware, hardware, or proprietar y technologies or enhancements to existing software, ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n21 hardware, or proprietary technologies, which means that we may not discover the errors or defects until after customer \\nimplementation. If our software, hardware, or proprietary techn ologies contain errors or defects, it could require us to \\nexpend significant resources to remedy these problems or defend /indemnify claims, which could reduce margins and result \\nin the diversion of technical and  other resources  from our othe r customer implementations and development efforts. \\nObjectionable disclosure of our customers’ confidential in formation or our failure to comply with our customers’ \\nsecurity rules, including for those related to SaaS access, AI  use, or our on-site access, could result in costly litigation, \\ncause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-goi ng business with existing customers. \\nIn the ordinary course of providing SaaS or other services enga gements, we may collect customers’ product, process, \\nand test information, personally-identifiable data about their employees needed to administ er licenses, and other \\nconfidential information. Our customers consider most of this i nformation to be competitively sensitive and, in some cases, \\nrequire us to comply with strict protection frameworks, includi ng security rules for on-site or remote access to, hosting of, \\nor transfer of their confidential information. As a result of i ncreased regulatory and customer scrutiny of all data processin g \\nactivities, as well as increasing and evolving regulation of su ch practices, we have security obligations on how we collect, \\ntransfer and use data (including personal data), which could re quire us to expend money and resources to comply with \\nthose requirements, and if compromised again, could have a mate rial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, \\nand results of operations, including the potential for regulato ry investigations, enforcement ac tions, lawsuits, and a loss of  \\nbusiness and a degradation of our reputation. If we fail to imp lement industry standard protections and processing \\nprocedures, the growing awareness of our customers and potentia l customers regarding privacy and data security \\nrequirements and/or adverse media  coverage or regulatory scruti ny could limit the use and adoption of our services. In \\naddition, to avoid potential disclosure of confidential informa tion to competitors, some of our customers may, in the future, \\nask us not to work with key products or processes, which could limit our revenue opportunities . We recently started using \\nthird party AI/ML systems for re search and development purposes . If these third-party AI/ML systems misuse or fail to \\nproperly protect the data we input, our use of such AI systems may result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive, \\nproprietary, or confidential information belonging to us or our  customers. For example, if the information we input into a \\nthird-party AI/ML system is used to train the underlying AI/ML models, such inputs could be revealed to others. The third-\\nparty AI/ML system may also provide outputs that appear to be c orrect but are incomplete, in accurate, or otherwise flawed \\nand may lead us to make erroneous decisions or recommendations to customers, which could result in harm to our \\nreputation and competitive positi on, customer lo ss, and legal l iability. \\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and a large percentage of our \\nrevenues from one customer, so defaults or decreased busine ss with, or the loss of, any one of these customers, or \\npricing pressure, or customer consolidation could signific antly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively impact \\nresults of operations. \\nHistorically, we have had a small number of large customers tha t contribute significant revenues. In the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 35% of our total revenues. We have in the past and could in the future \\nlose a customer due to its decision not to develop or produce i ts own future process node or not to engage us on future \\np r o c e s s  n o d e s .  W e  c o u l d  a l s o  l o s e  c u s t o m e r s  a s  a  r e s u l t  o f  i n d u stry factors, including but not limited to reduced \\nmanufacturing volume or consolidation. Consolidation among our customers could also lead to increased customer \\nbargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. Further, new business may be delayed or \\nprevented if a key customer uses  its leverage to push for terms  that are worse for us and we delay entering into the contract \\nto negotiate for better terms or decide not to enter into the c ontract at all, in which case revenue in any particular quarter  \\nor year may fail to meet expectations and our reliance on our r emaining customers could increase. \\nFurther, if any of our key customers default, declare bankruptc y or otherwise delay or fail to pay amounts owed, or \\nwe otherwise have a dispute with  any of these customers, our re sults of operations would be negatively affected in the \\nshort term and possibly the long term. For example, in 2023, 20 22 and 2021, we incurred expenses in the amount of $2.6 \\nmillion, $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related t o the arbitration with SMIC New Technology Research & \\nDevelopment (Shanghai) Corporation due to SMIC’s failure to pay  fees due to us under a series of contracts. In 2024, we \\nmay continue to incur substantial additional expenses related t o an arbitration hearing to resolve this matter. The loss of \\nrevenue from any of our key customers would cause significant f luctuations in results of operations because our expenses \\nare fixed in the short term and it takes us a long time to repl ace customers or reassign resources. ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n22 If we do not continuously meet our devel opment milestones of key research an d development projec ts or successfully \\ncommercialize our DFI system, our future market opportun ity and revenues will suffer, and our costs may not be \\nrecouped. \\nWe have invested significantly in the design and development of  our eProbe tool and related IP. Key customers failing \\nto purchase, renew, or expand the number or use of such systems  on our expected timeline or at all will cause our results \\nto miss expectations. Also, if t he results of our DFI system, i ncluding new applications, are not as we expect, we may not \\nbe able to successfully commercialize this system or such appli cations on schedule, or at all, and we may miss the market \\nopportunity and not recoup our investment. Further, our eProbe tool could cause unexpected damage to wafers or delay \\nprocessing wafers, which we could be liable for, or which could  make customers unwilling to use the tool. If we are not \\nable to create significant interes t and show reliable and usefu l results without significant damage to wafers, our investment \\nmay not be recouped and our future results may suffer. \\nWe are required to comply with governmental export and im port requirements that could subject us to liability and \\nrestrict our ability to sell our products and services, which co uld impair our ability to compete in international markets. \\nWe are required to comply with export controls and economic san ctions laws and regulations that restrict selling, \\nshipping, or transmitting our products and services and transfe rring our technology outside the United States. These \\nrequirements also restrict domestic release of software and tec hnology to foreign nationals. In addition, we are subject to \\ncustoms and other import requirem ents that regulate imports tha t are important for our busine ss. If we fail to comply with \\nthe U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) or other U.S . or non-U.S. export or economic sanctions laws and \\nregulations (collectively, “Export Regulations”), we could be s ubject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including \\nfines for the Company and the possible loss of the ability to e ngage in exporting and other in ternational transactions. Due \\nto the nature of our business and technology, Export Regulation s may also subject us to governmental inquiries regarding \\ntransactions between us an d certain foreign entities. \\nExport Regulations are fluid, complex, and uncertain, and there  are ongoing efforts throughout the industry in \\ncoordination with regulators to revise, clarify, and interpret Export Regulations. The U.S. Congress and regulators continue \\nto consider significant changes in laws and regulations. For ex ample, the U.S. government is reportedly considering \\nwhether and/or how to impose restrictions directly on cloud-hos ted services and further restrictions directly on U.S. person \\nactivity. We cannot predict the impact that additional legal ch anges may have on our business in the future. For example, \\nin October 2022 the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS” ) promulgated broad, novel Export Regulations relating \\nto China that temporarily caused us to pause some deliveries wh ile we interpreted the application of the new regulations \\non our business, given current and evolving operations. Also, B IS has placed certain entities on its entity list (the “Entity \\nList”), which restricts supply of  items to or in connection wit h the named entities. Further, in some circumstances Export \\nRegulations require a license to export an item if the recipien t will use the item to design or produce an item for a Huawei-\\naffiliated company or certain oth er organizations on the Entity  List. These regulations can also require licenses for exports \\nthat involve Chinese military or intelligence-related end users  or end uses. \\nFuture changes in Export Regulations, including changes in the enforcement and scope of such regulations, may create \\ndelays in the introduction of our products or services in inter national markets or could prevent our customers with \\ninternational operations from de ploying our products or service s globally. In some cases, such changes could prevent the \\nexport of our products or services to certain countries, govern ments, entities or individuals altogether. Any such delays or \\nrestrictions could adversely aff ect our business, financial con dition and results of operations. For further discussion, see \\nItem 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Cond ition and Results of Operations.”   \\nDecreases in wafer volumes at our customers’ manufacturing sites or the volume of ICs that some of our customers \\nare able to sell to their customers would caus e our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue to suffer. \\nOur Integrated Yield Ramp revenue includes amounts largely dete rmined by variable wafer volumes at manufacturing \\nsites covered by our contracts an d, in some cases, determined b y the volume of an IC product that our customer is able to \\nsell to its customers. Both of these factors are outside of our  control. We have seen a significant reduction in our Integrate d \\nYield Ramp revenue in recent years and expect this trend to con tinue. Further, some of our manufacturing customers’ \\nbusiness is largely dependent on customers that use our manufac turing customer as a second or third source. If those ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n23 customers consolidate and/or oth erwise move the orders to manuf acturing facilities not covered by our contracts, or \\nsuspend their manufacturing at covered facilities for any reaso n, including consolidation, our Integrated Yield Ramp \\nrevenue will continue to decrease, which could negatively affec t our financial results. Further, reduced demand for \\nsemiconductor products or protectionist policies like those ste mming from the complex relationships among China, Hong \\nKong, Taiwan, and the United Stat es has from time to time decre ased and may continue to decrease the volume of wafers \\nand, in some cases, products our customers are able to make or sell, which would also decrease our Integrated Yield Ramp \\nrevenue. Also, our customers may unilaterally decide to impleme nt changes to their manufacturing processes during the \\nperiod that volume is covered by royalty contracts, which could  negatively affect yield resu lts and, thus, our Integrated \\nYield Ramp revenue. \\nSince we currently work on a small number of large projects at specified manufacturing sites and, in some cases, on \\nspecific IC products, our results of operations have been and m ay continue to be adversely affected by negative changes \\nat those sites or in those products, including slowdowns in man ufacturing due to external factors, such as U.S. trade \\nrestrictions, rising inflation and global interest rates, or co ntinued or worsening supply chain disruptions. Also, if wafer \\norders from sites covered by our contracts are not secured by o ur customers, if an end product does not achieve commercial \\nviability, if a process line or, in some cases, a specific prod uct, does not achieve significant increases in yield or sustain  \\nsignificant volume manufacturin g during the time we receive roy alties, revenues associated with such volumes or products \\nwould be negatively impacted. This could significantly reduce o ur Integrated Yield Ramp revenue and our results of \\noperations could fail to meet expectations. In addition, if we work with two directly competitive manufacturing facilities \\nor products, volume in one may offset volume, and thus any of o ur related revenue, in the other facility or product. \\nWe acquired an early-stage battery-solutions provider and have been investing in research and development for new \\nproducts and services beyond our traditional semiconducto r focus, and it could take a long time to reach market \\nacceptance and recoup our costs, if at all. \\nIn July 2023, we acquired Lantern Machinery Analytics, Inc., an  early-stage company providing products and services \\nfor battery manufacturers, which is beyond our traditional semi conductor focus. We have also invested in research and \\ndevelopment to expand the application of our existing products and services to battery manufacturers. If we do not create \\nproducts and services battery manufacturers desire, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our solutions for \\nbattery manufacturing on schedule, or at all. In this case, we may miss the market opportunity, which would mean lower \\nsales than we expect, the loss of  our investments in battery ma nufacturing solutions, which would mean lower earnings. \\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business \\nthrough rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, which actions may have an adverse effect on our financial \\nand operating results. \\nOur ability to successfully offer o ur products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, \\nforecasting, and management proce ss to enable us to appropriate ly scale and adjust our business and business models in \\nresponse to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions, wh ich has in the past and could in the future continue to \\nrequire us to increase headcount,  acquire new companies or enga ge in restructurings from time to time. For example, while \\nwe have increased investment in our business by increasing head count, acquiring companies, and increasing our \\ninvestment in research and development, sales and marketing, an d other parts of our business from time to time, at other \\ntimes we have undertaken restructuring initiatives to reduce ex penses and align our operations with our evolving business \\nneeds. Some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed c osts that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to \\nfluctuations in our business or headcount. Rapid changes in the  size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including \\nsales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to d evelop and deliver products and services as planned or impair \\nour ability to realize our current or future business and finan cial objectives. Our ability to capitalize on the market \\nopportunity and achieve cost savings and other benefits from re structuring initiatives within the expected time frame \\nrequires significant management input and leadership and is sub ject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject \\nto significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, s ome of which are beyond our cont rol. If these estimates and \\nassumptions are incorrect, and we are unsuccessful at implement ing changes, or if other unf oreseen events occur, our \\nbusiness and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Such ev ents may result in restrictions, curfews, or other actions \\nand give rise to significant changes in regional and global eco nomic conditions and cycles, which may adversely affect \\nour financial and operating results. Further geopolitical uncer tainties, including relations between the United States and \\neach of China and Russia, between Israel and Palestine, social activism, economic instability, war, terrorism, or other \\ncircumstances that interrupt our ability to conduct business co uld cause damage to, disrupt, or cancel sales of our products \\nand services on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or vendors with \\nwhich we do business. Due to the significance of our China mark et for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in \\nChina, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the followin g: the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including \\nrounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing rest rictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-\\nAmericanism; escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing polit ical sensitivities in China; the effects of China \\ngovernment funding in the development of domestic solutions and  customer preference for domestic suppliers creating \\nadditional competition in China; and unexpected governmental re gulations and restrictions in China as a result of renewed \\nefforts to contain the COVID  -  19 pandemic, which could negativ ely impact our local operations . Such events could also \\nmake it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In addition, territorial invasions \\ncan lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology companies, such  as ours, located far outside of the conflict zone. We do \\nnot have a business continuity plan developed to account for al l continuity risks (please see Item 1C. Cybersecurity for \\nmore information about our cybersecurity risk management progra m). In the event of prolonged business interruptions or \\nnegative broad economic and security conditions due to politica l, geopolitical events, we could incur significant losses, \\nrequire substantial recovery tim e, and experien ce significant e xpenditures in order to resume our business operations. In \\naddition, our insurance policies typically contain a war exclus ion of some description and we do not know how our insurers \\nare likely to res pond in the event of a l oss alleged to have be en caused by geopolitical uncertainties. \\nGlobal economic conditions or semiconductor market cond itions could materially adversely impact demand for our \\nproducts and services, decrease our sales, or delay our sales cycle. \\nOur customers are global semico nductor companies, which means t hat our operations and performance depend \\nsignificantly on worldwide economic conditions as well as semic onductor market specific changes. Uncertainty about \\nglobal economic conditions including war, terrorism, geopolitic al uncertainties and other business interruptions could \\nresult in damage to, disruption, postponement or cancellation o f sales of our products or services on a global or regional \\nbasis. Furthermore, tighter credit, higher interest rates, infl ationary concerns, large-scale une mployment, negative financial  \\nnews and/or declines in income or asset values and other macroe conomic factors could have a material adverse effect on \\ndemand for our products and services and, accordingly, on our b usiness, results of operations or financial condition and/or \\nvendors with which we do business. For example, the timing of t he build-out of the semiconductor market in China depends \\nsignificantly on governmental funding on both local and nationa l levels and a delay in this funding could negatively affect \\nour revenues. Further, any economic and political uncertainty c aused by the United States tariffs imposed on goods from \\nChina or enhanced U.S. export regulations relating to China, am ong other potential countries, and any corresponding tariffs \\nfrom China or such other countri es in response, may negatively impact demand and/or increas e the cost for our products. \\nFurther, the semiconductor industry historically has been volat ile with up cycles and down cy cles, due to sudden changes \\nin customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending,  which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand \\nfor customers’ IC products by consumers, inventory levels relat ive to demand, and access to a ffordable capital. As a result \\nof the various factors that affe ct this volatility, the timing and length of any cycles can be difficult to predict and could be \\nlonger than anticipated. Any of these events could negatively a ffect our revenues and make it challenging or impossible \\nfor us to deliver products and se rvices to our customers foreca st our operating results, make business decisions, and identify  \\nthe risks that may affect our business, financial condition and  results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may \\nalso lead to additional credit losses. \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n25 We face challenges in providing a comprehensive solution ou tside of the semiconductor in dustry due to limitations on \\nthe business areas in which we can use current third-pa rty licensed technology, which may make it prohibitively \\nexpensive to sell our solution for applications outside of our traditional industry. \\nSince our software requires certa in third-party programs to run  as intended and some of our  contracts with licensors \\nlimit the industry in which we can resell such third-party prog rams, we face challenges to prov ide a comprehensive solution \\nto battery manufacturers. If we or our customers are unable to procure required third-party programs that can be used in \\nconnection with our products fo r battery manufacturing, or the cost to do so is higher than expected, we may miss the \\nmarket opportunity, which would mean lower sales than expected,  or our costs may be higher, which would mean lower \\nearnings than expected.    \\nRisks Related to  Our Technology \\nIf we fail to protect our IP rights, customers or potential competitors may be able to use our technologies to develop \\ntheir own solutions, which could weaken  our competitive position, reduce our revenues, or increase our costs. \\nOur success depends largely on the protection of our proprietar y technology. Our contractual, patent, copyright, \\ntrademark, and trade secret prot ection may not be effective aga inst any particular threat or in any particular location. Our \\npending patent applications may not result in issued patents, a nd even if issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to \\nprotect our proprietary technologies. Some foreign countries do  not currently provide effective legal protection for IP and \\nour ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may \\nalso be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently dev eloped by competitors. Litigation may be necessary from \\ntime to time to enforce our IP rights. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur \\nsubstantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also d ivert our resources, including our managerial and \\nengineering resources. If we are unable to exclude others from using our proprietary technologies and methods without \\ncompensation to us, through litigation or otherwise, it could i mpede our ability to grow our business and our revenues may \\nsuffer. \\nWe are exposed to risks related to information technology  infrastructure, information management and protection, \\ncybersecurity threats, and cyber incidents. \\nWe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as  well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to \\nprovide our products and services to our customers. Additionall y, we must frequently expand our internal information \\nsystem to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and comm unication, which may result in increased costs. Our \\ninternal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers’ \\ninformation that we transmit. Building and managing the support  necessary for our growth pl aces significant demands on \\nour management and resources. These demands may divert these re sources from the continued growth of our business and \\nimplementation of our business strategy. Bad actors may make in creased use of widely available access to generative AI \\ntechnology, such as ChatGPT, for  more sophisticated and frequen t cyber-attacks or fraudulent impersonations against us. \\nThese attacks could come from e ither Advanced Persistent Threat  actors or other individual organized or unorganized \\nmalicious actors.  The expense to purchase, update, and configu re security information system s to detect and/or neutralize \\nincreasingly complex and sophisticated attacks may increase our  costs and, failure to acquire the right expertise or systems \\nmay leave us vulnerable to attacks, which could expose our conf idential or competitive information or that of our \\ncustomers, which could expose u s to liability and have a negati ve impact on our reputation and business opportunity. \\nWe rely on third-party service providers to enable key services  to our customers, including for cloud services, \\nenterprise software, customer s upport portal software, and co-l ocation computing facilities. We have experienced in the \\npast, and may experience in the future, interruptions in our in formation systems on which our global operations depend or \\nunplanned downtime of the infrastructure that delivers our SaaS . Such an unplanned interruption, even if temporary, could \\nstop SaaS customers from accessing their hosted data or on-prem ise customers from downloading licensed software or \\ncritical security patches, or fro m accessing our support portal , which could mean that we may not meet our contractual \\ncommitments for such services to customers, which could reduce our revenue, incur liability, or result in damage to our \\nreputation and negatively impact future sales. Further, the inf ormation technology and infrastructure that stores and \\nprocesses our and our customers’ data is susceptible to continu ally evolving cybersecurity threats that become more ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 26}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n26 complex over time, especially with the rapid evolution of AI te chnologies, and may not be recognized until launched \\nagainst a target, all of which could result in unauthorized acc ess to, or acquisition of, our data, and interruption or disrup tion \\nof our business. We and our third-party service providers, with  whom we may share data, may be unable to anticipate \\nthese techniques or may not implement adequate preventative mea sures to prevent either u nauthorized access to our \\nsystems or services that could compromise customer data or othe r confidential information or result in a disruption of our \\nservices. In particular, like our peers, we are often the targe t of cyber-attacks by third par ties seeking unauthorized access  \\nto confidential or sensitive data, including customer confident ial information, or to disrupt our ability to provide services \\nfrom a broad range of threat actors, including foreign governme nts, criminals, competitors , computer hackers, cyber \\nterrorists and politically motivated groups or individuals. To date, we have not incurred any material costs from these \\nattacks.  The security measures we have integrated into our int ernal systems, SaaS, and software products, which are \\ndesigned to detect unauthorized intrusions or activity and prev ent or minimize security breac hes, vary in maturity across \\nour business and may not function as expected or may not be suf ficient to protect against certain attacks. Additionally, we \\nmay not have sufficient audit logs to fully understand the natu re of a cyber-attack.  In some cases, we do not have contracts \\nto provide legal protection or recourse for breaches of our sec urity protections, which may increase our exposure to \\nexpenses related to such attacks and negatively impact our resu lts. \\nRansomware attacks are becoming i ncreasingly prevalent and seve re, and can lead to significant interruptions in our \\noperations, loss of data and income, reputational loss, diversi on of funds, and may result in fines, litigation and unwanted \\nmedia attention. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling \\nor unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable  laws or regulations prohibiting payments. Territorial \\ninvasions like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or other geopolitic al events can lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology \\ncompanies, such as ours, located  far outside of the conflict zo ne. In the event of prolonged business interruptions due to a \\nsecurity breach or disruption, w e could incur significant losse s, require substantial recovery time and experience significant  \\nexpenditures in order to resume our business operations. \\nOur information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cy ber-related security breaches, and similar disruptions \\nfrom unauthorized intrusions, tam pering, misuse, criminal acts including phishing, or other events or developments that \\nwe may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate. Our securit y measures may also be circumvented or bypassed due to \\nemployee errors or malfeasance. Third parties may attempt to fr audulently induce employees or customers to disclose \\ninformation in order to gain acce ss to our data or our customer s’ data, including account cre dentials, customer personnel \\ninformation, or other information. If we fail to have adequate controls or safeguards, the secu rity of our internal networks, \\nelectronic systems, or physical facilities could be compromised , which could result in significant legal and financial \\nexposure, a loss of confidence in the security of our SaaS and other software products, interruptions, or malfunctions in \\nour operations, account lock outs , and, ultimatel y, harm to our  business, financial conditio n and results of operations. \\nWe face information technology se curity and fraud risks due to continued support of our employee’s remote or hybrid \\nwork environment, which may creat e additional information secur ity vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any \\ndisruption in our information technology systems. Our increased  reliance on work-from-anywhere technologies and even \\nour employees’ expanded reliance on company-approved bring-your -own-mobile-devices may increase the risk of \\ncybersecurity or data breaches f rom possible circumvention of s ecurity and monitoring systems, denial-of-service attacks \\nor other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer v iruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, \\nmalfeasance, social engineering, deep-fake impersonations, phys ical breaches, or other actions. \\nOur insurance policies may not cover losses incurred in the eve nt our systems or data are comprised, and they are \\nsubject to retention amounts that could be substantial. Moreove r, we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will \\ncontinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms , or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to \\nany future claim. \\nMany of our customers and our technical partners require us to complete annual vendor security assessments which \\nmay include a requirement to complete information security self -assessments, third-party assessments, or obtain \\nindependent certifications from standards organizations. Any ex ception of controls found during such assessments or \\ncertification, especially if published in a report such as for SOC 2 Type 2, may need to be disclosed to a large number of \\ncustomers and potential customers. Such publication of controls  weaknesses could cause customers to re-evaluate their \\npurchasing or renewal decisions, which could cause us to lose s ales and, as a result, have lo wer earnings than expected.

While such acquisiti ons offer strategic oppor tunities for growth and \\ndiversification, they also expose us to cybersecurity risks tha t may arise during the integration process and thereafter. \\nChallenges in integrating information technology systems and ne tworks may create vulnerabilities and expose the \\norganization to unaut horized access and data breaches. The tran sfer and consolidation of sensitive information during \\nacquisitions heighten data security and privacy concerns, poten tially leading to regulatory compliance issues and \\nreputational damage. Third-party relationships established by t he acquired company introduce additional cybersecurity \\nrisks if not properly assessed and mitigated. Moreover, cultura l differences, compliance obligations, and resource \\nconstraints further complicate th e effective management of cybe rsecurity risks associated with acquisitions, potentially \\nimpacting the organization's financial performance and reputati on. \\nIf we experience a security event , we may have to conduct an in vestigation and notify individuals, customers, partners, \\nservice providers and state, fed eral and local g overnmental aut horities and regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere around the \\nglobe.  Accordingly, security events could lead to significant costs and fees for legal adv ice, investigation support, \\nremediation, and result in legal risk exposure, damage and harm  to our reputation, and impact on our ability to keep and \\nattract customers. \\nWe and our customers are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy, data security, consumer protection, \\nand advertising and these laws and regulations are continually evolving, which exposes us to potential material risks. \\nWe collect, use, store or disclo se (collectively, “process”) pe rsonal information, including from employees and \\ncustomers, in connection with the operation of our business. Th e personal information we process is subject to an \\nincreasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws reg arding privacy and data security, as well as contractual \\ncommitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply w ith such obligations may result in governmental \\nenforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements ag ainst us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could \\ncause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an ad verse effect on our reputation and business. \\nIn the United States, we are sub ject to numerous federal, state  and local data privacy and security laws and regulations \\ngoverning the processing of information about individuals, incl uding federal laws (e.g., FTC Act) and state privacy laws \\n(e.g., the California Privacy rights Act and the Virginia Consu mer Data Protection Act), marketing and communications \\nlaws, laws regarding credit repo rts, data breach notification l aws, and consumer protection laws, many of which carry \\nsignificant potential for activ e enforcement and penalties. \\nAbroad, our customers may be subject to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR  or similar local or regional frameworks that \\nimpose a strict data protection compliance regime. Our customer s may impose these obligations on us by contract, which \\ncould require us to expend resources to comply with those requi rements. \\nMore generally, given the rapidly changing data privacy and dat a security laws, regulations, policies and legal \\nobligations discussed above, and  because any current compliance  is subject to change based on this shifting and \\ninconsistent landscape, we could incur costs of complying with these laws and regulations, which in some cases can be \\nenforced by our customers, other private parties in addition to  government entities, are high and likely to increase in the \\nfuture, particularly as the degr ee of regulation increases, our  business grows and our geographic scope and member base \\nexpands. The impact of these laws and regulations may dispropor tionately affect our business in comparison to our peers \\nin the technology sector that have greater resources. \\nOur technologies could infringe the IP rights of others, causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights. \\nSignificant litigation regarding IP rights exists in the semico nductor industry. It is possible that a third party may claim \\nthat our technologies infringe their IP rights or misappropriat e their trade secrets, which has happened in the past. Any \\nclaim, even if without merit, could be time consuming to defend , result in costly litigation, require us to enter into royalty  \\nor licensing agreements, which may not be available to us on ac ceptable terms, or at all, subject us to damages or \\ninjunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a pate nt or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to o ur \\ncustomers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign  certain of our products, any one of which could adversely \\naffect our sales opportunitie s, expenses, and revenues. \", metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 28}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n28 Competition in the market for data analytics and related syst ems and services may intensif y in the future , which could \\nimpede our ability to grow or execute our strategy. \\nOur industry is marked by rapid technological developments and innovations (such as the use of AI and ML) and \\nevolving industry standards. If we are unable to innovate quick ly enough to keep pace with our competitors in \\nincorporating such technological d evelopments in our product of ferings, our business could be harmed. See the discussion \\nin “Competition” in Part 1, Item 1. “Business” section for more  information about our current competitors. There may be \\nother competitors of which we are not aware, and we may compete  with the products or offerings of our existing competitor \\ncompanies or additional companies if we expand our offerings th rough acquisitions or development. The demand for \\nsolutions that address the need f or better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may \\nencourage new direct competitors to enter our market. Increased  competition could lead to increased pricing pressure, \\nnegatively impacting our revenues, or a decreased ability to gr ow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential \\ncustomers may choose to develop their own solutions internally,  particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or \\nimproving them to meet market needs. These and other competitor s may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than \\nour engineering organization, which would give any such competi tor’s products a competitive advantage over our \\nsolutions. \\nGenerative AI and the user other advanced AI technologies  for software development may subject us to claims of \\nmisappropriation of others’ IP, bugs/errors, and ambiguous ownership of created content. \\nUncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as gen erative AI content creation may require additional \\ninvestment to protect our proprietary datasets, ML models, and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which \\nm a y  b e  c o s t l y  a n d  c o u l d  i m p a c t  o u r  p r o f i t  m a r g i n  i f  w e  d e c i d e  t o expand generative AI into our product offerings. \\nDeveloping, testing, and deploying secure and reliable AI syste ms and tested software made using such AI systems may \\nalso increase the cost profile of our offerings. We would be li able for any inaccuracies or errors in software that we release  \\nthat causes downtime or other d amage to our customers’ faciliti es or production lines, which could greatly increase our \\nexpenses and decrease our earnings. \\nRisks Related to Our Operations \\nMeasurement of our variable consideratio n sometimes require data collection and customers’ use of estimates and are \\ncontingent upon customers’ consent and may be later offset if actual data differ from customers’ estimates, which can \\nresult in uncertainty and cause quarterly results to fluctuate. \\nWe can only recognize volume- or average selling price- (“ASP”)  based royalties once we have reached agreement \\nwith our customers on their level of yield performance improvem ents or ASP and quarterly agreements are sometimes \\nbased on estimates of volume res ults or ASP for each quarter. M easuring the amount of yield improvement is inherently \\ncomplicated and dependent on our customers’ internal processes and on certain non-public information that may not be \\ndirectly available to us. Thus, there may be uncertainty as to some components of measuremen t or calculation. Also, some \\nvariable consideration can be highly susceptible to delays in o ur customers’ measurement of key factors such as reporting \\nvolumes results and level of yield or ASP. Therefore, we may ha ve to estimate revenue related to contingent variable fees \\nor usage- or sales-based royalties prior to the receipt of perf ormance reports, such as royalty acknowledgements, or other \\nrelated information from customers. These estimates are subject  to judgment to evaluate whether it is probable that a \\nsignificant revenue reversal w ill not occur in future periods, which could result in our recogn ition of less Integrated Yield \\nRamp revenue than expected that may later be offset when actual  results become available if such results differ from \\nestimates. \\nWe have customers with past due balances and our failure to collect a significant portion of such balances could \\nadversely affect our cash, require us to write-off receivabl es, or increase our expense or allowance for credit losses. \\nIf our customers fail to pay receivable balances when due, our cash will decrease and we may have to incur additional \\nexpenses in an attempt to collect such receivables, to write-of f a portion or all of such receivables, or to increase our \\nexpense or allowance for credit losses. Our accounts receivable  balance, net of allowance fo r credit losses, was $44.9 \\nmillion and $42.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, res pectively. Unbilled accounts  receivable, included in ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 29}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n29 accounts receivable, totaled $ 16.4 million and $13.5 million as  of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unbilled \\naccounts receivable that are not expected to be billed and coll ected during the succeeding twel ve-month period are recorded \\nin other non-current assets and totaled $1.1 million and $0.8 m illion as of December 31, 2023 an d 2022, respectively. Two \\ncustomers accounted for 50% of our gross accounts receivable as  of December 31, 2023, and three customers accounted \\nfor 53% of our gross accounts r eceivable as of December 31, 202 2. The total allowance for cr edit losses was $0.9 million \\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We generally do not require c ollateral or other security to  support accounts receivable. \\nDespite the financial ability of these customers to pay for on- going services by PDF under valid contracts, customers may \\ndelay payments. Our allowances for potential credit losses, if any, could be insufficient, and we may need to adjust our \\nallowance for credit losses from  current estimates or write-off  receivables depending on such claims in the future. If we \\nare forced to pursue legal remedies to collect receivables, our  expenses could rise significantly and our business \\nrelationship and future business with these customers could suf fer. \\nWe face operational and financial risks associated with international operations that could negatively impact our \\nrevenues. \\nIn recent years, we have derived nearly half of our revenues fr om sales outside of the United States, and we expect \\nour international business to continue to grow. We have in the past expanded and reorganized, at different times, our \\noperations, including international operations, and may in the future continue such expansions or reorganizations by \\nestablishing or restructuring international subsidiaries, offic es, or contractor relationships in locations, if and when, \\ndeemed appropriate by our management. Thus, the success of our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business \\ninternationally, including in particular: \\n• our potential growth in China is dependent upon continued inves tments in the semiconductor industry by \\nboth private and public entities within China. Should circumsta nces change such that the level of investments \\nis substantially reduced, our futu re growth potential may be li mited; \\n• some of our key engineers and other personnel are foreign natio nals and they may not be permitted access to \\ncertain technical information un der U.S. export laws or by cert ain of our customers and may have difficulty \\ngaining access to the United States and other countries in whic h our customers or our offices may be located, \\nand it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees in foreign \\noffices; \\n• ineffective or inadequate protec tion or enforcement of our IP i n foreign jurisdictions; \\n• greater difficulty in collecti ng account receivables resulting in longer collection periods, credit losses, and \\nincreased costs to collect; \\n• language and other cultural differences may inhibit our sales a nd marketing efforts and create internal \\ncommunication problems between our U.S. and foreign teams, incr easing the difficulty of managing \\nmultiple, remote locations and negatively impacting sales and r evenue; \\n• compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and \\nregulatory environments with which we are not familiar includin g, among others, issues related to human \\nresources, personal data, tax, protection of our IP, and a wide  variety of operational regulations and trade and \\nexport controls under domestic, foreign, and international law;  \\n• currency risk due to certain of our payables and our internatio nal offices’ payables are denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies, including the Euro, Yen, and RMB, while predominant ly all of our revenues is denominated in \\nU.S. dollars, or in the event a larger portion of our revenues becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we \\nwould be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate ris k; \\n• inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business d isruptions; ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n30 • additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncert ainty around changes in tax laws of various \\ncountries; \\n• geopolitical instability or changes in government, including in  the United States of America, could disrupt \\nour operations or our customers’ purchases or operations or tho se of related supply chain participants; \\n• quarantine, travel restrictions, or business disruptions in reg ions affecting our operations, stemming from \\nactual, imminent or perceived outbreaks of contagious diseases,  including COVID  -  19; or \\n• economic or political instability, including but not limited to  armed conflict, terrorism, interference with \\ninformation or communication of networks or systems, including strained or worsening relations between \\nthe United States and China, occupation or war involving Russia  and Ukraine and most recently between \\nIsrael and Hamas, and the resu lting disruption to economic acti vity and business operations. \\nFurther, our employees and contractors include professionals lo cated in various international locations, including \\nShanghai, China and Ramallah, Palestine, and Israel, and Taiwan  who provide software-related development, quality \\nassurance, maintenance, and oth er technical support services fo r certain of our software products. Conflicts in these regions \\nor impacting these regions, or policy changes, including polici es covering export controls, that affect these or other \\ninternational operations could d isrupt or limit the work our em ployees and contractors perfor m and may negatively affect \\nthe range of services we are able  to provide or our cost for su ch services. \\nIn addition, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S.  and foreign laws and regulations, including those \\nrelated to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and oth er disclosures, privacy, and \\nlabor relations. These laws and regulations are complex and may  have differing or conflicting legal standards, making \\ncompliance difficult and costly . In addition, there is uncertai nty regarding how proposed, contemplated, or future changes \\nto these complex laws and regulations could affect our business . We may incur substantial expense in complying with new \\nobligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we  may be required to make significant changes in our \\nbusiness operations, all of which may adversely affect our reve nues and our business overall. Given the high level of \\ncomplexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example \\nthrough fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employee s, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation \\nrequirements or otherwise. If we  violate these laws and regulat ions, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal \\nsanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in on e or more countries. Additiona lly, we may be held liable \\nfor actions taken by our local dealers and partners. A signific ant violation could significantly  negatively impact our sales \\nopportunities, operations, and financial results. Some companie s in China have indicated to us that they have decided to \\nuse only local vendors as a precaution. If more companies respo nd to changing regulations by using local vendors, then \\nour operations and ability to deliver products and services to customers in China and elsewhere could be significantly \\nnegatively impacted. In such case, our expected international b usiness may be slower than exp ected or not materialize at \\nall, in which case, our sales opportunities, operations, and fi nancial results would suffer. \\nFurther, the U.S. government has imposed broad sanctions on Rus sia, Belarus and certain companies and high-wealth \\nindividuals relating to the invasion of Ukraine, and has additi onally maintained a bipartisan consensus favoring increased \\nconfrontation of China on trade practices and economic matters,  national security, and human rights. The current U.S. \\nAdministration views technology a s a domain of strategic compet ition in which the U.S. and its allies must stay ahead of \\nChina and has identified semiconductor, AI, 5G technologies, an d the protection of U.S. supply chains as priority efforts. \\nAs a result of these government actions and policies, unless an d until related restrictions are lifted, we are generally not \\nable to supply many products, services and technologies to affe cted entities and countries. Our standard operations include \\ndevelopment, distribution proce sses, software download sites, a nd professional service centers and processes located in \\nvarious geographies around the world. Some customers have expre ssed concerns that continued action by the U.S. \\ngovernment could potentially interrupt their ability to make us e of our products or services. The continuing tension \\nbetween the U.S. government and each of the Chinese and Russian  governments in trade and security matters or the \\nperception of that tension could lead to further disruptions or  reductions in international trade, deter or prevent customer \\npurchasing activity, and may nega tively impact our  financial re sults.

In \\naddition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employ ees, and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG matters \\nand related disclosures. These c hanging rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to \\ncontinue to result in, increased g eneral and administrative exp enses and increased management time and attention spent \\ncomplying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. Fo r example, developing and acting on ESG initiatives, and \\ncollecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metric s can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is \\nsubject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s pr oposed climate-related reporting requirements. We may \\nalso communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding enviro nmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social \\ninvestments, and other ESG matte rs in our SEC filings or in oth er public disclosures. These i nitiatives and goals could be \\ndifficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed t o implement them may not be cost effective and may not \\nadvance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for th e accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of \\nour ESG initiatives. Further, statements about our ESG initiati ves and goals, and progress against those goals, may be \\nbased on standards for measuring progress that are still develo ping, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, \\nand assumptions that are subject to change. In addition, we cou ld be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or  \\ngoals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or \\nif we fail to achieve progress w ith respect to our ESG goals on  a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial  \\nperformance and growth could be adversely affected. \\nProvision of certain of our data services relies on installin g, configuring, and operating proprietary configuration of \\nhardware and software systems located in third-party fac ilities and errors affecting such facilities’ operations could \\nlead to liability for us, and any objection from such third-party facility or delay in providing us physical or logical \\naccess to our systems may adversely impact our ability to  timely perform our contract obligations or lead to \\nconfidentiality, integrity, availability, security, or privacy controls exceptions. \\nIn connection with our data serv ices offerings, we rely on inst alling, configuring, and operating proprietary \\nconfigurations of hardware and  software systems in facilities o wned and operated by third parties around the world. If the \\nthird-party facility owner/operator does not allow us to instal l, access and maintain, or otherwi se operate as intended these \\nsystems, we may not timely fulfill our contractual obligations to, or expectations of, our customers. Also, any intentional \\nor unintentional disruption of the operation of these proprieta ry systems may lead to customer dissatisfaction, which could \\ncause us to lose future bookings and reduce revenue and negativ ely impact our earnings. Additionally, any potential or \\nactual malicious cybersecurity i ncident or accidental misconfig uration resulting in a data security incident involving these \\nproprietary systems may require complex diagnosis and mitigatio n because they are located at third-party facilities and \\nthis may lead to delays, errors, lack of system availability, l oss or our customers’ data integrity, or further unauthorized \\ndisclosure of customer confidential or privacy data. Further, i f our system causes downtime or other disruption or loss to \\nsuch third-party facility, we could be liable for damages assoc iated with such event, which could increase our expenses \\nand distract management, and cause other third-party facilities  to not want to work with us. \\nInstalling and maintaining such proprietary systems around the world requires that we manage the complexity of \\nglobal operations of individual installations at a large number  of different third parties in various countries. The cost and \\ncomplexity of obtaining support, installing updated security pa tches, and addressing any other critical vulnerabilities in \\neach individual physical system may lead to exceptions in contr ols of confidentiality, availability, integrity, security, and \\nprivacy, which could negatively impact the availability of our data services to customers, damage our reputation, or lead \\nto lower bookings or sales.

Our filings are subject \\nto reviews or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We cannot be sure that \\nany final determination in an audit would not be materially dif ferent than the treatment refl ected in our historical income \\ntax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed a s a result of an audit, there could be a significant negative \\neffect on our income tax provision and our operating results in  the period or periods for which that determination is made. \\nAny changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jur isdictions, including those re sulting from transfer pricing \\nadjustments, could materially i ncrease our effective tax rate. \\nOn August 9, 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (the “CHIP S Act”) was enacted in the United States to provide \\ncertain financial incentives to the semiconductor industry, pri marily for manufacturing activitie s within the United States. \\nOn January 19, 2024 the House Ways and Means Committee passed w ith bipartisan support a proposed “tax bill” which \\nwould retroactively restore the three expired business tax prov isions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through the end of \\n2025, including the requiremen t to capitalize and amortize Sect ion 174 research and experimentation (“R&E”) \\nexpenditures. The provision would delay the date when taxpayers  must begin capitalizing and amortizing their “domestic” \\nR&E expenditures until taxable years beginning after December 3 1, 2025, while leaving the requirement to capitalize \\nforeign research unchanged. This change would be retroactive fo r taxpayers who have already filed tax returns for taxable \\nyear 2022. The tax bill is pending vote in the House and Senate . We are continuing to monitor the CHIPS Act and the \\nproposed tax bill and related regulatory developments to evalua te their potential impact on our business and operating \\nresults. For further discussion of the CHIPS Act, see Item 7. “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \\nCondition and Results of Operations”. \\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax asset position, in cluding the utilizatio n of net operating loss and tax credit \\ncarryforwards. \\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily u pon future taxable income in the applicable jurisdiction. \\nWe previously recorded a full valuation allowance against all o f our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets due to the \\nuncertainty surrounding the future realization of these deferre d tax assets. Therefore, no benefit has been recognized for \\nthe net operating loss carryforw ards, tax credit carryforwards,  and other deferred tax assets . The net operating loss and tax \\ncredits could expire unused and be unavailable to reduce future  income tax liabilities. We intend to continue maintaining \\na full valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until t here is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or \\nsome portion of these allowances. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability each reporting period. The impact \\nof releasing some or all of such valuation allowance in a futur e period could be a material benefit in the period in which \\nsuch release occurs. \\nRisks Related to Our Strategic Transactions \\nWe may devote significant time and resources to developing st rategic relationships but we may not realize the benefits \\nof such efforts, which could ha ve an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \\nWe have in the past devoted, and plan in the future to devote, time and resources to identifying, developing, and \\npromoting strategic relationships with other suppliers to provi de combined, integrated, or interoperable solutions to the \\nsemiconductor, electro nics, and automotive industries. For exam ple, from July 2020 through August 2023, we announced \\nstrategic relationships or collaborations with Advantest Corpor ation, Siemens, Kulicke & Sof fa Industries, Inc., SAP SE, \\nproteanTecs Ltd, and Voltaiq, Inc. The full extent of the futur e impact of these strategic relationships on our financial \\ncondition and results of operations is currently unknown and th e failure to reap the anticipated  benefits of these companies’ \\nfinancial resources, technology, customer relationships, and gl obal footprint and/or to successfully develop combined, ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 33}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n33 integrated, or interoperable solutions with such companies coul d have an adverse effect on our business and results of \\noperations. \\nOur acquisitions create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results. \\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and b roaden our product offerings in response to changing \\ntechnologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures. To t his end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the \\nprocess of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible acq uisition transactions, and, fro m time to time, acquiring one \\nor more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the f uture. We may choose to acquire new and complementary \\nbusinesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of d eveloping them ourselves. For example, we acquired \\nCimetrix in December 2020 for a gross purchase price of approxi mately $37.5 million ($31.6 million net of cash acquired) \\nfor all of its outstanding equity. We may, however, face compet ition for acquisition targets from larger and more \\nestablished companies with great er financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions. We may \\nnot be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favora ble terms and we may not realize the benefits that we \\nanticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate. In tegrating any business, product, technology, or service \\ninto our current operations could be expensive and time-consumi ng and/or disrupt our ongoing business. Further, there are \\nnumerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acqui sitions, including, but not limited to, problems combining \\nthe purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipat ed costs, liabilities, litigation, and diversion of \\nmanagement’s attention from our core businesses, adverse effect s on existing business relationships with suppliers and \\ncustomers, risks associated with  entering markets in which we h ave no or limited prior experience, and where competitors \\nin such markets have stronger market positions, initial depende nce on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply \\npartners, failure of our due diligence processes to identify si gnificant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acqui red \\ncompany or technology, and the potential loss of key employees,  customers, distributors, vendors, and other business \\npartners of the companies we acquire. \\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate businesses, produc ts, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire \\nand the transaction may not advance our business strategy. The integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to \\nbe a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated r evenues or other benefits \\nassociated with our acquisitions . If we fail to successfully ma nage, operate, or integrate any acquired business or if we are \\nunable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, inclu ding through the use of common information and \\ncommunication systems, operating procedures, financial controls , and human resources practices, we could be required to \\nwrite-down investments and our business, financial condition, a nd results of operations may be adversely affected. We \\nmay also be unable to protect or enforce the IP rights of any t arget business that we acquire, or such target businesses may \\nbecome subject to claims of IP in fringement. Further, if we bec ome subject to liabilities as a result of an acquisition, the \\nliabilities we incur may be substantial and the amounts of such  liabilities may not be covered by and/or may exceed any \\nliability protections. \\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we have in the past an d may in the future issue common stock, or assume \\nequity awards, that dilute the ownership of our current stockho lders, use a substantial portion of our cash resources, assume \\nliabilities (both known and unknow n), record goodwill and amort izable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment \\ntesting on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment ch arges, incur amortization expenses related to certain \\nintangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and  restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could \\nharm our financial condition and results of operations. \\nGeneral Risk Factors \\nIf we are not able to retain, attract, motivate, and strategi cally locate talented employees,  including some key executives, \\nour business may suffer. \\nOur success and competitiveness depend on our ability to retain , attract, motivate, and str ategically locate in our \\noffices around the globe, talented employees, including some of  our key executives. Achieving this objective may be \\ndifficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global  economic and industry conditions, changes in our \\nmanagement or leadership, the hiring practices at our competito rs or customers, cost reduction activities, and the \\neffectiveness of our recruiting and compensation programs, incl uding equity-based programs.  Further, we have had, and ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 34}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n34 expect to continue to have, difficulty in obtaining visas permi tting entry for some of our employees that are foreign \\nnationals into the United States, and delays in obtaining visas  permitting entry into other key  countries, for several of our \\nkey personnel, which disrupts our ability to strategically loca te our personnel. In the past th e United States has and, in the  \\nfuture, the United States may again increase the level of scrut iny in granting H  -  1(b), L  -  1, and other business visas. \\nCompliance with United States immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and \\nexpenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled profes sionals. If we lose the services of certain of our key executiv es \\nor a significant number of our engineers, it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy. If we do not \\nsuccessfully attract, retain, an d motivate key employees, inclu ding key executives, we may be unable to realize our \\nbusiness objectives and our operating results may suffer. \\nOur earnings per share and other operating results may vary  quarter to quarter, which could result in not meeting \\ninvestors’ expectations and stock price volatility. \\nOur stock price has fluctuated widely during the last few years . A factor in the volatility may be that our historical \\nquarterly operating results have fluctuated. Our future quarter ly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time \\nand may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and in vestors in some future period, which could cause our stock \\nprice to decrease. A significant reduction in our stock price n egatively impacts our ability to raise equity capital in the \\npublic markets and increases the cost to us, as measured by dil ution to our existing shareholders, of equity financing. In \\naddition, the reduced stock price also increases the cost to us , in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee \\ncompensation or for acquisitions of other businesses. A greatly  reduced stock price could also have other negative results, \\nincluding the potential loss of confidence by employees, the lo ss of institutional investor interest, a hostile take-over bid,  \\nand fewer business development opportunities. Also, significant  volatility in our stock price could be followed by a \\nsecurities class action lawsuit, which could result in substant ial costs and a diversion of o ur management’s attention and \\nresources. \\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact \\nthe trading value of our securities. \\nIn recent years, shareholder ac tivists have become involved in numerous public companies, including our company. \\nShareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of a \\ncompany. Such proposals may disrupt our business, increase our expenses, and divert the attention of our Board of \\nDirectors and our management and employees, and any perceived u ncertainties as to our future direction resulting from \\nsuch a situation could result in the loss of potential business  opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strat egic \\nplan be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our curr ent or potential customers, and make it more difficult to \\nattract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, a ll of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy \\ncontest for the election of direct ors at our annual meeting cou ld also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy \\nsolicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist shareho lders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price \\nbased on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other f actors that do not necessar ily reflect the underlying \\nfundamentals and prospects of our business. \\nItem 1B.

Reserved  \\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\nOverview \\nWe offer products and services des igned to empower organization s across the semiconductor and electronics \\necosystems to connect, collect, manage, and analyze data about design, equipment, manufacturing, and test to improve the \\nyield and quality of their produc ts. We derive revenues from tw o sources: Analytics and In tegrated Yield Ramp. Our \\nofferings combine proprietary software, professional services u sing proven methodologies and third-party cloud-hosting \\nplatforms for SaaS, electrical m easurement hardware tools, and physical IP for IC designs. We primarily monetize our \\nofferings through license fees and contract fees for profession al services and SaaS. In some cases, especially on our \\nhistorical Integrated Yield Ramp  engagements, we also receive a  value-based variable fee or royalty, which we call \\nGainshare. Our products, services, and solutions have been sold  to IDMs, fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, \\nOSATs, capital equipment manuf acturers and system houses. \\nIndustry Trends \\nCertain trends may affect our Analytics revenue specifically. I n particular, the confluence of Industry 4.0 (i.e. the \\nfourth industrial revolution, or the automation and data exchan ge in manufacturing technologies and processes) and cloud \\ncomputing (i.e. the on-demand a vailability of computing resourc es and data storage without d irect active management by \\nthe user) is driving increased innovation in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing and analytics, as well as in the \\norganization of information technology (“IT”) networks and comp uting at semiconductor and electronics companies across \\nthe ecosystem. First, the ubiquity of wireless connectivity and  sensor technology enables any manufacturing company to \\naugment its factories and visualize its entire production line.  In parallel, the cost per terabyte of data storage has general ly \\ndecreases over time. The combination of these two trends means that more data is collected and stored than ever before. \\nFurther, semiconductor companies  are striving to analyze these very large data sets in real-time to make rapid decisions \\nthat measurably improve manufacturing efficiency and quality. I n parallel, the traditional practice of on-site data storage, \\neven for highly sensitive data, is changing. The ability to cos t-effectively and securely store, analyze, and retrieve massive  \\nquantities of data from the cloud versus on-premise enables dat a to be utilized across a much broader population of users, \\nfrequently resulting in greater demands on analytics programs. The combination of these latter two trends means that \\ncloud-based, analytic programs that effectively manage identity  management, physical secur ity, and data protection are \\nincreasingly in demand for insight s and efficiencies across the  organizations of these companies. We believe that all these \\ntrends will continue for the next few years, and the challenges  involved in adopting Industry 4.0 and secure cloud \\ncomputing will create opportunities for our combination of adva nced analytics capabilities, proven and established \\nsupporting infrastructure, and professional services to configu re our products to meet customers’ specialized needs.

For example, semic onductor manufacturers have rec ently been experiencing lower wafer shipments, which \\nhas negatively impacted our Integrated Yield Ramp gainshare rev enue. The logic foundry market at the leading-edge \\nnodes, such as 7nm, 5nm, and smaller, underwent significant cha nge over the past few years. The leading foundry \\ncontinues to dominate market share. This trend will likely cont inue to impact our Characteri zation services business on \\nthese nodes. We expect most logic foundries to invest in deriva tives of older process nodes, such as 28nm and 14nm, to \\nextract additional value as many of their customers will not mo ve to advanced nodes due to either technological barriers \\nor restrictive economics. Foundries that participate at leading  edge nodes are expected to continue to invest in new \\ntechnologies such as memory, packaging, and multi-patterned and  extreme ultraviolet lithography, as well as new \\ninnovations in process control and variability management. We e xpect China’s investment in semiconductors to continue. \\nCompliance with changing U.S. export restrictions limit our pos sible business with Chinese semiconductor manufacturers \\non advanced nodes. As a result of these market developments, we  have chosen to focus our resources and investments in \\nproducts, services, and solutions for analytics. \\nThere are other global or business trends that may affect our b usiness opportunities generally as follows:  \\n• Macroeconomy, inventories, and demand . The worldwide economy did not  recover as strongly or quickly as \\nexpected after the COVID  -  19 pandemic, and recession fears persist. As a result of the sl ow recovery, inventories \\nof semiconductor devices remain el evated in many instances. The  strength of demand for semiconductor products \\nhas varied by region and product segment. For example, demand f or graphical processing unit products is strong, \\nwhile demand for smart phones is weak. With high inventories an d soft demand, semiconductor fab utilization \\nrates are also low and semiconduc tor capital equipment orders h ave been impacted for s ome vendors and market \\nsegments. As a result of these trends, customers are being caut ious with their spend and some purchase cycles are \\nlengthening and other purchase decisions are being delayed, par ticularly with respect  to larger deals.    \\n• Changing export controls and sanctions . The U.S. government continues to expand and intensify export controls \\nand sanctions, with a major focus on the destinations of the Pe ople’s Republic of China (“P.R.C.”), Russian \\nFederation, and Belarus. After an internal evaluation, we deter mined that a large percentage of our software \\nproducts are not of U.S. origin and are, thus, not subject to t he EAR. Our standard operations include \\ndevelopment, distribution proce sses, software download sites, a nd professional service centers and processes \\nlocated in various geographies around the world to better serve  our customers. Some customers in the P.R.C., in \\nparticular, have nonetheless expressed concerns to us that cont inued action by the U.S. government could \\npotentially interrupt their ability to make use of our products  or services, which has in some cases, and could in \\nthe future, negatively impact the demand for our products and s ervices by these customers. In October 2022 and \\nO c t o b e r  2 0 2 3 ,  t h e  U . S .  g o v e r n m e n t  i s s u e d  i n t e r i m  f i n a l  r u l e s  a d ding novel and complex export control \\nrestrictions, some exclusions, a nd requests for public comment.  In light of questions about some restrictions and \\nguidance, the U.S. government announced on November 6, 2023 tha t it was developing revisions to such rules to \\nmake corrections and clarifications. We believe the government will issue these revisions in 2024, along with \\nadditional restrictions. U.S. government policy and regulation remain fluid and uncertain. Other countries and \\njurisdictions with important roles in our industry are updating  some of their export control regulations to further \\nalign with those of the U.S. government and, in some cases, to counter U.S. regulations. For example, the P.R.C. \\nhas imposed restrictions on imports of certain memory ICs offer ed by U.S. companies and has been developing \\nits legal authorities to counter foreign sanctions. The U.S. go vernment is renewing and amplifying its caution that \\nvisitors to the P.R.C. are subj ect to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and wrongful detention, a risk that could \\ndeter or hinder certain business activities. Based on our curre nt assessments, we expect the near-term impact of \\nthese expanded trade restrictions on our business to be limited , but revisions, clarifications, and proposals that \\nare still in government development and open questions of inter pretation leave much unknown. We will continue \\nto monitor for any further trade restrictions, other regulatory  or policy changes by the U.S. or foreign governments \\nand any actions in response.  The uncertainty caused by these r ecent regulations and the potential for additional \\nfuture restrictions could negatively affect our future sales in  the P.R.C. market. \\n• Investments in semiconductor manufacturing . In 2022, the U.S. Congress passed into law funding programs f rom \\nthe bipartisan CHIPS Act, authorizing the Department of Commerc e, Department of Defense, and Department of \\nState to develop onshore domestic  manufacturing of semiconducto rs considered critical to U.S. competitiveness ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 41}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n41 and national security. It is exp ected that U.S. semiconductor c ompanies, especially manufacturers, will increase \\nspending as a result of receiving funds under these programs. R ecipients of funding under such programs may be \\nrequired to agree to separate restrictions on certain commercia l activity in the P.R.C., where we currently \\ncommercially operate. If our customers engage us for projects f unded by these programs, we will evaluate all \\nrestrictions, and their impact on our existing business, before  entering into any contract s associated with these \\nprograms.   \\n• Geopolitical tensions/conflicts . Geopolitical tensions and conflicts in various locations arou nd the world continue \\nto increase, including on the issue of Taiwan in Asia, Ukraine and Russia, and most recen tly between Israel and \\nHamas. These current situations have created volatility in the global financial markets and may have further \\nglobal economic consequences, including potential disruptions o f the global supply chain and heightened \\nvolatility of commodity and raw material prices. This has incre ased fears of a global recession. We have \\ncontractors located in the West Bank and in Israel, who are pro viding software development and customer \\ntechnical support services, and have developed contingency plan s to use alternative resources to continue serving \\ncustomers, if needed. Any escala tions could lead to disruptions  or reductions in international trade, deter or \\nprevent purchasing activity of customers, and negatively impact  our development timelin es and customer support \\n(with respect to the Israel-Hamas  conflict) or China sales (wit h respect to U.S.-P.R.C. tensions) and financial \\nresults in general (with respect to global tensions). \\nFinancial Highlights \\nThe following are our financial h ighlights for the year ended D ecember 31, 2023: \\n• Total revenues were $165.8 million, an increase of $17.3 millio n, or 12%, compared to the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2022. An alytics revenue was $152.1 million, an inc rease of $21.6 million, or 17%, compared to \\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 . The increase in Analytics rev enue was driven by increases in revenue from \\nDFI and CV systems, including sales-type leases of DFI assets, and an increase in revenue from Exensio software \\nlicenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from Cimet rix software licenses due to a decrease in orders for \\nruntime licenses. Integrated Yi eld Ramp revenue decreased $4.3 million, or 24%, compared to the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2022 , primarily due to a decrease in hours worked on fixed fee engagements and a decrease in \\nGainshare from decreased custome r wafer shipments at non-leadin g-edge nodes. \\n• Costs of revenues increased $3.8 million for the year ended Dec ember 31, 2023, compared to the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2022 , primarily due to increases in hardware costs , travel expenses, subcont ractor fees and software \\nlicenses and maintenance costs. T hese increases were partially offset by decreases in personnel-related costs. \\n• Net income was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 202 3, compared to a net loss of $3.4 million for \\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 . The increase in net income wa s primarily attributable to (i) an increase in \\ntotal revenues, (ii) an increase in interest income, (iii) a de crease in research and development expenses and (iv) a \\ndecrease in income tax expenses, partially offset by increases in (a) costs of revenues, (b) selling, general, and \\nadministrative expenses, which we re primarily related to increa ses in personnel-related c osts, travel expenses, \\nlegal fees related to the arbitration proceeding over a dispute d customer contract, third-party cloud-services \\nrelated costs, property tax expenses, general legal expenses, t rade conference-related expenses, and business \\nacquisition costs, and (c) foreign  currency transaction exchang e losses. \\n• Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $3. 7 million to $135.5 million as of December 31, \\n2023, from $139.2 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily du e to payments to vendors, payments of accrued \\nbonuses and income taxes, purchases of and prepayments for prop erty and equipment, payme nts of taxes related \\nto net share settlement of equity awards, payments for a busine ss acquisition, and repurchases of common stock, \\npartially offset by cash collection from customers, interest in come from cash, cash equivalents and short-term \\ninvestments, and proceeds from purchases under our employee sto ck purchase plan and exe rcise of stock options.

Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements describe the signif icant accounting policies and met hods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements. We consider the accounting policies described below  to be our critical accounting policies. These critical \\naccounting policies are impacted s ignificantly by judgments, as sumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the \\nConsolidated Financial Stateme nts and actual results could diff er materially from the amounts reported based on these \\npolicies. \\nRevenue Recognition \\nWe derive revenue from two sources : Analytics and Integrated Yi eld Ramp. \\nAnalytics Revenue \\nAnalytics revenue is derived from the following primary offerin gs: licenses and services for standalone \\nSoftware (which consists primarily of Exensio and Cimetrix prod ucts), SaaS (which consists primarily of Exensio \\nproducts), and DFI and CV systems (including Characterization s ervices) that do not include performance incentives based \\non customers’ yield achievement. \\nRevenue from standalone software is recognized depending on whe ther the license is perpetual or time-based. \\nPerpetual (one-time charge) licen se software is recognized at t he time of the inception of the arrangement when control \\ntransfers to the customers, if the software license is distinct  from the services offered by us. Revenue from post-contract \\nsupport is recognized over the co ntract term on a straight-line  basis, because we are providing (i) support and \\n(ii) unspecified software updates on a when-and-if available ba sis over the contract term. Revenue from time-based-\\nlicensed software is allocated t o each performance obligation a nd is recognized either at a point in time or over time as \\nfollows. The license component is recognized at the time when c ontrol transfers to customers, with the post-contract \\nsupport component recognized ratably over the committed term of  the contract. For contracts with any combination of \\nlicenses, support, and other serv ices, distinct performance obl igations are accounted for sep arately. For contracts with \\nmultiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction p rice of the contract to each p erformance obligation on a \\nrelative basis using the standal one selling price (“SSP”) attri buted to each perfo rmance obligation. \\nRevenue from SaaS arrangements, which allow for the use of a cl oud-based software product or service over a \\ncontractually determined period of time without taking possessi on of software, is accounted for as subscriptions and is \\nrecognized as revenue ratably, on a straight-line basis, over t he subscription period beginning on the date the service is \\nfirst made available to customers. \\nRevenue from DFI systems and CV s ystems (including Characteriza tion services) that do not include performance \\nincentives based on customers’ yield achievement is recognized primarily as services are performed. Where there are \\ndistinct performance obligations, we allocate revenue to all de liverables based on their SSPs. For these contracts with \\nmultiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction p rice of the contract to each p erformance obligation on a \\nrelative basis using SSP attrib uted to each performance obligat ion. Where there are not discr ete performance obligations, \\nhistorically, revenue is primar ily recognized as services are p erformed using a percentage of completion method based on \\ncosts or labor-hours inputs, which ever is the most appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. \\nThe estimation of percentage of c ompletion method is complex an d subject to many variables that require significant \\njudgment. \\nThe Company also leases some of its DFI system and CV system as sets to some customers. The Company determines \\nthe existence of a lease when the customer controls the use of these identified assets for a period of time defined in the \\nlease agreement and classifies such leases as operating leases or sales-type leases. A lease is classified as a sales-type lea se \\nif it meets certain criteria unde r Topic 842, Leases; otherwise , it is classified as an operating lease. Operating lease reven ue \\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Sal es-type lease revenue and corresponding lease receivables are ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 43}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n43 recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the future lease payments, and related interest income \\non lease receivable is recognized  o v e r  t h e  l e a s e  t e r m  a n d  a r e  r ecorded under Analytics Revenue in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Payments under sales -type leases are discounted using the interest rate \\nimplicit in the lease. When the Company’s leases are embedded i n contracts with customers that include non-lease \\nperformance obligations, the Co mpany allocates consideration in  the contract between lease and non-lease components \\nbased on their relative SSPs. Assets subject to operating lease s remain in Property and equipment, net and continue to be \\ndepreciated. Assets subject to sales-type leases are derecogniz ed from Property and equipment at lease commencement \\nand a net investment in the lease asset is recognized in Prepai d expenses and other current assets and Other non-current \\nassets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp Revenue \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp revenue is derived from our yield ramp en gagements that include Gainshare or other \\nperformance incentives  based on customers’ yield achievement. \\nRevenue under these project–based  contracts, which are delivere d over a specific period of time typically for a fixed \\nfee component paid on a set sched ule, is recognized as services  are performed using a percentage of completion method \\nbased on costs or labor-inputs, whichever is the most appropria te measure of the progress towards completion of the \\ncontract. Where there are distin ct performance obligations, we allocate revenue to all delivera bles based on their SSPs and \\nallocate the transaction price of the contract to each performa nce obligation on a relative basis using SSP. Similar to the \\nservices provided in connection with DFI systems and CV systems  that are contributing to Analytics revenue, due to the \\nnature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimat ion of percentage of completion method is complex and \\nsubject to many variables that require significant judgment. \\nThe Gainshare royalty contained in yield ramp contracts is a va riable fee related to continued usage of our IP after the \\nfixed-fee service period ends, based on the customers’ yield ac hievement. Revenue derived from Gainshare is contingent \\nupon our customers reaching certa in defined production yield le vels. Gainshare royalty periods are generally subsequent \\nto the delivery of all contractual services and performance obl igations. We record Gainshare as a usage-based royalty \\nderived from customers’ usage of IP and record it in the same p eriod in which the usage occurs. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe are required to assess whether  it is “more likely than not” that we will realize our deferred tax assets. If we believe \\nthat they are not likely to be fully realizable before the expi ration dates applicable to such assets, then to the extent we \\nbelieve that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuat ion allowance. Based on all available evidence, both positive \\nand negative, we determined a full valuation allowance was stil l appropriate for our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax \\nassets (“DTAs”), primarily drive n by a cumulative loss incurred  over the 12  -  quarter period ended December 31, 2023, and \\nthe likelihood that we may not utilize tax attributes before th ey expire. The valuation allo wance was approximately $64.2 \\nmillion and $59.2 million as of D ecember 31, 2023 and 2022, res pectively. We will continue to evaluate the need for a \\nvaluation allowance and may change our conclusion in a future p eriod based on changes in facts (e.g., 12  -  quarter \\ncumulative profit, significant new revenue, etc.). If we conclu de that we are more likely than not to utilize some or all of \\nour U.S. DTAs, we will release so me or all of our valuation all owance and our tax provision will decrease in the period in \\nwhich we make such determination. \\nWe evaluate our DTAs for realizability considering both positiv e and negative evidence, including our historical \\nfinancial performance, projections of future taxable income, fu ture reversals of existing taxa ble temporary differences, tax \\nplanning strategies and any carryback availability. In evaluati ng the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future \\ntaxable income based on management approved business plans. Thi s process involves significant management judgment \\nabout assumptions that are subject to change from period to per iod based on changes in tax laws or variances between \\nfuture projected operating performance and actual results. Chan ges in the net DTAs, less offsetting valuation allowance, \\nin a period are recorded through the income tax provision and c ould have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements \\nof Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Our \\ntax filings, however, are subject to audit by the respective ta x authorities. Accordingly, we recognize tax liabilities based \\nupon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, addition al taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely-\\nthan-not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will  not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of \\nbeing sustained. To the extent the final tax liabilities are di fferent than the amounts originally accrued, the increases or \\ndecreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \\n(Loss). As of December 31, 2023, no deferred taxes have been pr ovided on undistributed earnings from our international \\nsubsidiaries. We intend to reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S . subsidiaries in those operations indefinitely. As such, we \\nhave not provided for any foreign withholding taxes on the earn ings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023. The \\nearnings of our foreign subsidiaries are taxable in the U.S. in  the year earned under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed \\nIncome rules implemented under 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \\nThe CHIPS Act was signed into U.S. law on August 9, 2022. The C HIPS Act is intended to increase domestic \\ncompetitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing capacity, increa se research and development in computing, AI, clean \\nenergy, and nanotechnology through federal government programs and incentives over the next ten years. The CHIPS Act \\nincludes an advanced manufacturing tax credit equal to 25% of q ualified investments in property purchased for an \\nadvanced manufacturing facility. We have begun to see some bene fit from the CHIPS Act to our business, but the extent \\nof future benefit is still unknown. \\nStock-Based Compensation \\nWe account for stock-based compensation using the fair value me thod, which requires us to measure stock-based \\ncompensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards a nd recognize the compensation expense over the requisite \\nservice period. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has \\nbeen reduced for estimated fo rfeitures. Forfeitures are estimat ed at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequen t \\nperiods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. \\nThe fair value of our restricted  stock units is equal to the ma rket value of our common stock on the date of the grant. \\nThese awards are subject to time-based vesting which generally occurs over a period of four years. \\nThe fair value of our stock optio ns and purchase rights granted  under employee stock purchase plans is estimated \\nusing the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which inco rporates various assumptions including volatility, \\nexpected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is ba sed on the historical volatility of our common stock over the \\nmost recent period commensurate with the estimated expected lif e of our stock options and purchase rights granted under \\nemployee stock purchase plans. T he expected life is based on hi storical experience and on the terms and conditions of the \\noptions granted and purchase rights granted under employee stoc k purchase plans. The interest rate assumption is based \\nupon observed Treasury yield curve rates appropriate for the ex pected life of our stock options and purchase rights granted \\nunder employee stock purchase plans. \\nBusiness Combinations \\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tan gible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible \\nassets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the dat e of the business combination. The excess of the fair value of \\npurchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiab le assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such \\nvaluations require us to make significant estimates and assumpt ions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant  \\nestimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are  not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future \\nexpected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technolog y, acquired patents, and trade names from a market \\nparticipant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. The e stimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed \\nto be reasonable, but which are  inherently uncertain and unpred ictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from \\nestimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable  assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as \\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over thei r useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, \\nincluding in-process research and development and goodwill, are  not amortized. During the measurement period, which \\nis not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 45}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n45 with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments \\nare recorded to earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Comp rehensive Income (Loss). \\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill and Intangible Assets \\nWe record goodwill when the purch ase consideration of an acquis ition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and \\nidentified intangible assets as of the date of acquisition. We have one operating segment and one operating unit. We \\nperform an annual impairment asse ssment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or more frequently, \\nif required to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in \\nthe overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit \\nbelow its carrying amount, incl uding goodwill. If events or cir cumstances do not indicate that  the fair value of a reporting \\nunit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not conside red to be impaired and no further testing is required. If the \\ncarrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss woul d be recognized equal to the amount of excess, limited to \\nthe amount of total goodwill. The re was no impairment of goodwi ll for the years ended D ecember 31, 2023, 2022 and \\n2021. \\nOur long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, consist of property,  equipment, and intangible assets. We periodically \\nreview our long-lived assets for impairment . For assets to be held and used, we initiate our review wheneve r events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicat e that the carrying amount of a  long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. \\nRecoverability of an asset group is measured by comparison of i ts carrying amount to the ex pected future undiscounted \\ncash flows that the asset group is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an \\nimpairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. There \\nwas no impairment of intangible assets for the years ended Dece mber 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. In fiscal 2021, we wrote \\ndown the value of property and equipment aggregating $3.2 milli on pertaining to our first-gen eration of e-beam tools for \\nDFI™ systems where carrying values may not be fully recoverable  due to lack of market deman d and future needs of our \\ncustomers for these tools. \\nLeases \\nWe have operating leases for our  administrative and sales offic es, research and development laboratory and clean \\nroom. We recognize our long-term operating lease rights and com mitments as operating lease right-of-use assets, operating \\nlease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, non-current,  respectively, on our Consolidated  Balance Sheets. \\nWe determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at ince ption. Operating lease right-of-use assets, and operating \\nlease liabilities are initially recorded based on the present v alue of lease payments over the lease term. Lease terms include  \\nthe minimum unconditional term of the lease, and may include op tions to extend or terminate the lease when it is \\nreasonably certain at the commen cement date that such options w ill be exercised. The decision to include these options \\ninvolves consideration of our overall future business plans and  other relevant business econ omic factors that may affect \\nour business. Since the determination of the lease term require s an application of judgment, lease terms that differ in realit y \\nfrom our initial judgment may potentially have a material impac t on our Consolidated Balan ce Sheets. In addition, our \\nleases do not provide an implicit rate. In determining the pres ent value of our expected lease payments, the discount rate \\nis calculated using our incremental borrowing rate determined b ased on the information available, which requires \\nadditional judgment. \\nRecent Accounting Pronouncemen ts and Accounting Changes \\nSee our Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Signifi cant Accounting Policies” of “Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements” included u nder Part II, Item 8 of this Fo rm 10  -  K for a description of recent accounting \\npronouncements and accounting changes, including the dates of a doption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated \\nfinancial statements.

Th e increase in A nalytics revenue was driven by increases in revenue \\nfrom DFI and CV systems, including sales-type leases of DFI ass ets, and an increase in revenue from Exensio software \\nlicenses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from Cimet rix software licenses due to a decrease in orders for runtime \\nlicenses. \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp Revenue \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp revenue was  $13.8 million for the year en ded December 31, 2023, a decrease of $ 4.3 million, \\nor 24%, compared to the year end ed December 31, 2022, primarily  due to a decrease in hours worked on fixed fee \\nengagements and a decrease in Gai nshare from decreased customer  wafer shipments at non-leading-edge nodes. \\nOur Integrated Yield Ramp revenue may continue to fluctuate fro m period to period primarily due to the contribution \\nof Gainshare royalty, which is dependent on many factors that a re outside our control, including among others, continued \\nproduction of ICs by our customers at facilities at which we ge nerate Gainshare, sustained yield improvements by our \\ncustomers, and whether we enter into new contracts containing G ainshare. \\nOur revenues may also fluctuate in the future due to other fact ors, including the semiconductor industry’s continued \\nacceptance of our products, ser vices and solutio ns, the timing of purchases by existing and new customers, cancellations \\nby existing customers, our ability  to attract new customers and  penetrate new markets, supply chain challenges and further \\npenetration of our current custo mer base.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \\nThe following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange \\nrates. We do not curre ntly own any e quity inve stments,  nor do w e expect to own any in the foreseeable future. This \\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject  to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary \\nmaterially as a result of a number of factors. \\nInterest Rate Risk.  As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $135.5 \\nmillion. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash and highly  liquid money market instruments. Short-term investments \\nconsisted of U.S. Government securities. We would not expect ou r operating results or cash flows to be affected to any \\nsignificant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market i nterest on our portfolio. A hypothetical increase in market \\ninterest rates of 100 basis poin ts from the market rates in eff ect at December 31, 2023, would cause the fair value of short-\\nterm investments to decrease by a n immaterial amount which woul d not have significantly impacted our financial position \\nor results of operations. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, and periodically throughout the year, we have maintained cash balances in various \\noperating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. We li mit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution \\nby evaluating the creditworthin ess of the financial institution s with which we invest and investing through more than one \\nfinancial institution. \\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk.  Certain of our receivables and payables for our international offices are \\ndenominated in the local currency, including the Euro, Yen and RMB. Therefore, a portion of our revenues and operating \\nexpenditures are subject to foreign currency risks. From time t o time, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to \\nreduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuati ons on certain foreign currency denominated monetary \\nassets and liabilities. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We record \\nthese forward contracts at fair value. The counterparty to thes e foreign currency forward contracts is a financial institution  \\nthat we believe is creditworthy, and therefore, we believe the credit risk of counterparty non-performance is not significant.  \\nThe change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in earn ings as a component of other income (expense), net and \\noffsets the change in fair value of foreign currency denominate d monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in \\nother income (expense), net. As of December 31, 2023, we had no  outstanding forward contracts. \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 53}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n53 Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \\n \\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \\nTo the Board of D irectors and Stockholders of \\nPDF Solutions, Inc.  \\nOpinion on the Consolidat ed Financial Statements \\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of  PDF Solutions, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its \\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of \\ncomprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flo ws for each of the three years in the period ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, and the relate d notes (collectively referred  to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our \\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company  \\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022,  and the results of its operat ions and its cash flows for each of the three years in the \\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting p rinciples generally accepted in the United States of \\nAmerica. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the P ublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financia l reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria \\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of \\nthe Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2024 , expressed an unqualified opinion. \\nBasis for Opinion \\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to \\nexpress an opinion on the Compan y’s consolidated financial stat ements based on our audits. We are a public accounting \\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independe nt with respect to the Company in accordance with the \\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regul ations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \\nPCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the  PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reas onable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits include d performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the consolidated f inancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that \\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit s also included evaluating the accounting principles used \\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evalua ting the overall presentation o f the consolidated financial \\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable bas is for our opinion. \\nCritical Audit Matter \\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arisin g from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that was communicated  or required to be communicated  to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts \\nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical  audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on \\nthe consolidated financial state ments, taken as a whole, and we  are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, \\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures  to which they relate. \\nRevenue Recognition \\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements , the Company derives revenue from Analytics and \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp. Contracts with customers can include var ious combinations of licenses, subscriptions, products \\nand services, some of which are distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obliga tions. Significant judgment ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 54}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n54 is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for customer agreements, incl uding determining whether \\nlicenses, subscriptions, and services are distinct performance obligations, determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) \\nattributed to each performance ob ligation, establishing the pat tern of delivery for each distin ct performance obligation, \\nand estimating variable consider ation when determining the amou nt of revenue to recognize. In addition, for revenue under \\nproject-based contracts for fixed- price services, revenue is re cognized as services are perfo rmed using a percentage-of-\\ncompletion (“POC”) method based on costs or labor-hours input m ethod. \\nEstimated costs to complete each contract are based on i) futur e labor and product costs and ii) expected productivity \\nefficiencies. Changes in these estimates can have a material ef fect on revenue recognized and/ or related costs. Finally, the \\nCompany recognizes Gainshare royalty revenue in the same period  in which the usage occurs. The Company accrues the \\nrelated revenue based on estimates of customers’ underlying sal es achievements. These estimates are based on historical \\ndata, trends, seasonality, changes in contract rate, knowledge of changes in the industry and changes in the customer’s \\nmanufacturing environment learned through discussions with cust omers and sales personnel. \\nThe principal audit considerations for our determination that p erforming procedures related to the Company’s revenue \\nrecognition for customer agreem ents is a critical audit matter are the significant amount of judgment required by \\nmanagement in this process. Significant judgment is required in  determining SSP as the Compa ny rarely licenses software \\non a standalone basis, so the Company is required to estimate t he range of SSPs for each performance obligation, which \\nin turn leads to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and  effort in performing audit procedures in assessing the \\nallocation of SSPs to performan ce obligations. In addition, sig nificant judgment is required in determining the total \\nestimated contract costs for fix ed-price contracts, which in tu rn leads to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and \\neffort in performing audit procedures and in evaluating audit e vidence relating to the total estimated contract costs. \\nSignificant judgment is also required in recording Gainshare ro yalty revenue in the same period in which the usage occurs. \\nThe Company generally does not receive acknowledgment reports f rom customers during a given quarter, so the Company \\nis required to accrue the related revenue based on estimates of  customers underlying sales achievement, which in turn \\nleads to significant auditor ju dgment, subjectivity, and effort  in evaluating the reasonablene ss of these estimates based on \\nhistorical data, trends, seasonality and other factors. \\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evalua ting audit evidence in connection with forming our \\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These  procedures included testing t he effectiveness of internal \\ncontrols relating to the revenue recognition process, including  internal controls related to (1 ) the identification of distinc t \\nperformance obligations and data  used to establish SSP for lice nses, subscriptions, products and services, (2) project \\nestimates to completion for fixe d fee arrangements accounted fo r under POC and (3) estimates of Gainshare royalty \\nrevenue accrual and subsequent tr ue-ups. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating management’s \\nsignificant accounting policies related to these customer agree ments for reasonableness. In addition, for a sample of \\ncustomer agreements, we obtained and read contract source docum ents, including master agreements and other documents \\nthat were part of the agreement, tested management’s identifica tion of significant terms for completeness, including the \\nidentification of distinct performance obligations and variable  c o n s i d e r a t i o n ,  a s s e s s e d  t h e  t e r m s  i n  t h e  c u s t o m e r  \\nagreements and evaluated the app ropriateness of management’s ap plication of their accounting policies, along with their \\nuse of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition c onclusions, and tested the mathematical accuracy of \\nmanagement’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the consolidated financial \\nstatements. In addition, we eval uated the reasonableness of man agement’s estimates of SSP for projects and services that \\nare not sold separately, where applicable, costs to complete fo r project-based contracts for  fixed-price services and \\ncustomers’ underlying achievements for royalty revenue. \\n/s/ BPM LLP \\n \\nWe have served as the Comp any’s auditor since 2018. \\n \\nSan Jose, California \\nFebruary 27, 2024 \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 55}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n55 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \\nTo the Board of D irectors and Stockholders of \\nPDF Solutions, Inc. \\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting o f PDF Solutions, Inc.

In our \\nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effe ctive internal control over financial reporting as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by COSO. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the P ublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolid ated balance sheets as of Decemb er 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated \\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity , and cash flows for each of the three years in the period \\nended December 31, 2023 and the r elated notes (collectively ref erred to as the “consolidated f inancial statements”) of the \\nCompany, and our report dated February 27, 2024 expressed an un qualified opinion on those consolidated financial \\nstatements. \\nBasis for Opinion \\nThe Company’s management is res ponsible for maintaining effecti ve internal control over financial reporting and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of  internal control over financ ial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s \\nReport on Internal Control Over F inancial Reporting. Our respon sibility is to express an opinion on the entity’s internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a p ublic accounting firm registered with PCAOB and are \\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accor dance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \\napplicable rules and regulations  of the Securities and Exchange  Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform \\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control over financial reporting was maintained \\nin all material respects. Our audit of internal control over fi nancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of \\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk t hat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the \\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such \\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstance s. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis \\nfor our opinion. \\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial R eporting \\nAn entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a proc ess designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of conso lidated financial statements for external purposes in \\naccordance with accounting princi ples generally accepted in the  United States of America. An entity’s internal control \\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures  that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in \\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactio ns and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide \\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessar y to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements \\nin accordance with accounting pr inciples generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance wi th authorizations of management and directors of the \\nentity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding preventi on or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the entity’s assets  that could have a material e ffect on the consolidated  financial statements. \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 56}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n56 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over fina ncial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future period s are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of complia nce with the policies or p rocedures may deteriorate. \\n/s/ BPM LLP \\n \\nSan Jose, California \\nFebruary 27, 2024  \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 57}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n57 PDF SOLUTIONS, INC. \\nCONSOLIDATED B ALANCE SHEETS \\n(in thousands, except par values) \\n \\n  December 31, \\n      2023     2022 \\nASSETS        \\nCurrent assets:        \\nC a s h  a n d  c a s h  e q u i v a l e n t s  ..................................... ................  $   9 8 , 9 7 8   $ 1 1 9 , 6 2 4\\nShor t- t e r m  i n v e s t m e n t s  ............................................. ...........     3 6 , 5 4 4   1 9 , 5 5 7\\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses ..............................     4 4 , 9 0 4   4 2 , 1 6 4\\nP r e p a i d  e x p e n s e s  a n d  o t h e r  c u r r e n t  a s s e t s  ..................... ....................     1 7 , 4 2 2   1 2 , 0 6 3\\nT o t a l  c u r r e n t  a s s e t s  .......................................... ................     1 9 7 , 848  193,408\\nProperty and equipment, ne t .....................................................     3 7 , 3 38  40,174\\nOperatin g lease ri ght-of-use assets, ne t ............................................     4 , 9 2 6   6 , 0 0 2\\nGoodwill ............................................................... .....     1 5 , 0 2 9   1 4 , 1 2 3\\nIntan gible assets, ne t ...........................................................     15,620  18,055\\nDeferred tax assets, ne t .........................................................     157  64\\nO t h e r  n o n - c u r r e n t  a s s e t s  ...................................... ..................     1 9 , 2 1 8   6 , 8 4 5\\nT o t a l  a s s e t s  .................................................. ..............  $   2 9 0 , 136  $ 278,671\\n     \\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY        \\nCurrent liabilities:        \\nAccounts pa ya b l e  .......................................................... . .   $  2,561  $ 6,388\\nA c c r u e d  c o m p e n s a t i o n  a n d  r e l a t e d  b e n e f i t s  ..................... ..................     1 4 , 8 0 0   1 6 , 9 4 8\\nAccrued and other current liabilities .............................................     4 , 6 3 3   5 , 5 8 1\\nOperating lease liabilities – c u r r e n t  p o r t i o n  .......................................     1 , 529  1,412\\nDeferred revenues – c u r r e n t  p o r t i o n  .............................................     25,750  26,019\\nBillings in excess of recognized revenues .........................................     1 , 5 7 0   1 , 8 5 2\\nTotal current liabilities .....................................................     5 0 , 8 4 3  58,200\\nL o n g - t e r m  i n c o m e  t a x e s  ........................................ ................     2 , 9 7 2   2 , 6 2 2\\nNon-current portion of operatin g lease liabilities ....................................     4 , 6 5 7   5 , 9 3 2\\nOther non-current liabilities .....................................................     2 , 7 1 8   1,905\\nTotal liabilities ............................................................     61,190  68,659\\nCommitments and contin gencies (Note 6)        \\nStockholders’ equity:        \\nPreferred stock, $0.00015 par value, 5,000 shares authorized, n o shares issued and \\noutstandin g .............................................................. .....    —  —\\nCommon stock, $0.00015 par value, 70,000 shares authorized; sha res issued 49,749 \\nand 48,613, respectivel y; shares outstandin g 38,289 and 37,431, respectivel y............     6   6\\nA d d i t i o n a l  p a i d - i n  c a p i t a l  .................................... ...................     4 7 3 , 295  447,415\\nTreasur y stock at cost, 11,460 and 11,182 shares, respectivel y.........................

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTIN G POLICIES \\nDescription of Business \\nPDF Solutions, Inc. (the “Company” or “PDF”), provides products  and services designed to empower organizations \\nacross the semiconductor and el ectronics ecosystem to connect, collect, manage, and analyze data about design, equipment, \\nmanufacturing, and test to improve the yield and quality of the ir products and operational efficiency. The Company’s \\nproducts, services, and solutions include proprietary software,  physical intellectual property ( “IP”) for integrated circuit \\n(“IC”) designs, electrical measure ment hardware tools, proven m ethodologies, and professional services. \\nBasis of Presentation \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of t he Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after \\nthe elimination of all significant intercompany balances and tr ansactions. \\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with gene rally accepted accounting principles in the United \\nStates (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets \\nand liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabil ities at the date of the financial statements and the reported \\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. S ignificant estimates in these fi nancial statements include \\nrevenue recognition, the estimated useful lives of property and  equipment and intangible assets, assumptions made in \\nanalysis of allowance for credit losses, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, \\nimpairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation for def erred tax assets, and accounting for lease obligations, stock-\\nbased compensation expense, and income tax uncertainties and co ntingencies. Actual results could differ from those \\nestimates and may resu lt in material effects on the Company’s o perating results and financial position. \\nConcentration of Credit Risk \\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose the Company to co ncentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash \\nand cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts rece ivable. As of December 31, 2023, and periodically \\nthroughout the year, the Company had cash balances in various o perating accounts in excess of  federally insured limits. \\nThe Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and short-t erm investments with what it considers high credit quality \\nfinancial institutions. \\nThe Company primarily sells its p roducts and services to compan ies in Asia, Europe, and North America within the \\nsemiconductor industry. As of D ecember 31, 2023, two customers accounted for 50% of the Company’s gross accounts \\nreceivable and one customer accounted for 35% of the Company’s total revenues for 2023. As of December 31, 2022, \\nthree customers accounted for 53%  of the Company’s gross accoun ts receivable and two cust omers accounted for 41% of \\nthe Company’s revenues for 2022. Two customers accounted for 27 % of the Company’s revenues for 2021. See Note 11 \\nfor further details. The Company does not require collateral or  other security to support acco unts receivable. To reduce \\ncredit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition. The Company maintains \\nallowances for potential credit losses. \\nThe allowance for credit losses, which was based on management’ s best estimates, could be adjusted in the near term \\nfrom current estimates depending on actual experience. Such adj ustments could be material to the consolidated financial \\nstatements. ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 63}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n63 Supplier Concentration \\nSome of the Company’s vendors provide highly specialized, diffe rentiated products and services related to the \\nCompany’s eProbe system and some licensors provide key enabling  software for the Company’s products and services. In \\nthe event any of these suppliers delay or discontinue providing  such products and services to the Company, it may be \\ndifficult for the Company to replace such suppliers, software, or parts in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or \\nmake impossible the Company’s ability to deliver or adequately support its software systems or to complete and deliver \\nits eProbe systems to its custome rs, and could negatively impac t the Company’s future finan cial results of operations. \\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments \\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with effect ive maturities of 90 days or less on the date of \\npurchase to be cash equivalents and investments with effective maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year to be \\nshort-term investments. The Company classifies its securities w ith readily determinable market values as “available-for-\\nsale”. Short-term investments include available-for-sale securi ties and are carried at estimated fair value, with the \\nunrealized gains and unrealized non-credit-related losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other \\ncomprehensive income (loss) in s tockholders’ equity. Unrealized  credit-related losses are recorded to interest and other \\nexpense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Compreh ensive Income (Loss) with a corresponding allowance \\nfor credit-related losses in the  Consolidated Balance Sheets. R ealized gains and losses are based on the specific \\nidentification method and are included as a component of intere st and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Comprehe nsive Income (Loss). \\nThe Company periodically reviews  short-term investments for imp airment. For investments in unrealized loss \\npositions, the Company assesses whether any portion of the decl ine in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to \\ncredit-related factors if the Company neither intends to sell n or anticipates that it is more likely than not that it will be \\nrequired to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.  The Company considers factors such as the extent to which \\nthe market value has been less than the amortized cost basis, a ny noted failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or \\nprincipal payments, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and other relevant credit-related factors in \\ndetermining whether or not a credit loss exists. There was no a llowance for credit-related losses on any of the Company’s \\ninvestments recognized  in the years ended December 31 , 2023, 20 22 and 2021. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022,  short-term investments consi sted solely of U.S. Government securities. The cost \\nof these securities approximated fair value and there was no ma terial gross realized or unrealized gains or losses as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and  2022. Refer to Note 12, “Fair Value Measu rements” for further discussion on the Company’s \\ninvestments. \\nThe Company recorded interest income from its cash, cash equiva lents, and short-term investments of $5.5 million, \\n$1.5 million and $0.1 million in t he years ended December 31 20 23, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nAccounts Receivable \\nAccounts receivable include amounts that are unbilled at the en d of the period that are expected to be billed and \\ncollected within a 12  -  month period. Unbilled accounts receivable are determined on an  individual contract basis. Unbilled \\naccounts receivable, included in accounts receivable, totaled $ 16.4 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. U nbilled accounts receivable that are not e xpected to be billed and collected during the succeeding \\n12  -  month period are recorded in other non-current assets and total ed $1.1 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively.  \\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customer s’ financial condition. An allowance for credit \\nlosses is maintained for probable credit losses based upon the Company’s assessment of the expected collectibility of the \\naccounts receivable.

S h o rter of estimated useful life or term of lease\\nIntangible Assets \\nIntangible assets consist of acquired technology, certain contr act rights, customer relationships, patents, trademarks \\nand trade names. These intangible assets may be acquired throug h business combinations or direct purchases. Intangible \\nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estima ted useful lives which range from one to ten years. The \\nCompany continually monitors events and changes in circumstance s that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived \\nassets, including property and eq uipment and intangible assets,  may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in \\ncircumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of  long-lived assets. Recoverability of an asset group is \\nmeasured by comparison of its car rying amount to the expected f uture undiscounted cash flows that the asset group is \\nexpected to generate. If it is determined that an asset group i s not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount  \\nby which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fai r value. \\nGoodwill \\nThe Company records goodwill when the purchase consideration of  an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net \\ntangible and identified intangible assets as of the date of acq uisition. The Company has one operating segment and one \\noperating unit. The Company performs a qualitative analysis whe n testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. The \\nCompany performs an annual imp airment assessment of goodwill du ring the fourth quarter of each calendar year or more \\nfrequently, if required to determine if any events or circumsta nces exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or \\na decline in the overall industry demand, that would indicate t hat it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a \\nreporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. I f events or circumstances do no t indicate that the fair value \\nof a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill  is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is \\nrequired. If the carrying amount  exceeds its fair value, an imp airment loss would be recogn ized equal to the amount of \\nexcess, limited to the amo unt of total goodwill. \\nLeases \\nThe Company has operating leases for administrative and sales o ffices, research and development laboratory and clean \\nroom. The Company recognizes long-term operating lease rights a nd commitments as operating lease right-of-use ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 65}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n65 (“ROU”) assets, operating leas e liabilities and operating lease  liabilities, non-current, respectively, in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets. The Company elect ed to not separate lease and n on-lease components f or all of its leases. \\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lea se at inception. Operating lease ROU assets, and \\noperating lease liabilities are initially recorded based on the  present value of lease paymen ts over the lease term. Lease \\nterms include the minimum unconditional term of the lease, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when \\nit is reasonably certain at the commencement date that such opt ions will be exercised. The decision to include these options \\ninvolves consideration of the Company’s overall future business  plans and other relevant business economic factors that \\nmay affect its business. Since the determination of the lease t erm requires an app lication of judgment, lease terms that \\ndiffer in reality from the Company’s initial judgment may poten tially have a material impact on the Company’s \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate. In determining the present \\nvalue of the Company’s expected lease payments, the discount ra te is calculated using the Company’s incremental \\nborrowing rate determined based on the information available, w hich requires additional judgment. \\nSoftware Development Costs \\nInternally developed software is software developed to meet the  Company’s internal needs to provide certain services \\nto the customers. The Company’s capitalized software developmen t costs consist of internal compensation related costs \\nand external direct costs incurred during the application devel opment stage and are amortized over their useful lives, \\ngenerally five to six years.  \\nThe costs to develop software th at is marketed externally consi sting of external direct costs and internal compensation \\nrelated costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of  the software product has been established. Costs incurred \\nprior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as  incurred. Technological feasibility is established when the \\nCompany has completed all planning, designing, coding, and test ing activities that are necessary to establish that the \\nsoftware product can be produced  to meet its design specificati ons. Capitalization of such costs ceases when the software \\nproduct is generally available to customers. These software dev elopment costs are amortized using the greater of the \\nstraight-line method or the usag e method over its estimated use ful life. \\nCost of Revenues \\nCosts of revenues consist primarily of costs incurred to provid e and support the Company’s services, costs recognized \\nin connection with licensing its software, IT and facilities-re lated costs and amortization of acquired technology. Service \\ncosts include material costs, har dware costs (including cost of  leased assets under sales-type leases), personnel-related \\ncosts (including compensation, employee benefits, bonus and sto ck-based compensation expense), subcontractor costs, \\noverhead costs, travel, and allocated facilities-related costs.  Software license costs consist o f costs associated with cloud-\\ndelivery related expenses and licensing third-party software us ed by the Company in providing services to its customers \\nin solution engagements or sold in conjunction with the Company ’s software products. \\nResearch and Development Expenses \\nResearch and development expense s consist primarily of personne l-related costs (including compensation, employee \\nbenefits, bonus and stock-based compensation expense), outside development services, travel, third-party cloud-services \\nrelated costs, IT and facilities cost allocations to support pr oduct development activities. Research and development \\nexpenses are charged to operations as incurred. \\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs (including compensation, \\nemployee benefits, bonus, commissi on and stock-based compensati on expense for sales, marketing and general and \\nadministrative personnel), legal, tax and accounting services, marketing communications and trade conference-related \\nexpenses, third-party cloud-serv ices related costs, travel, IT and facilities cost allocations.

As stock-based compe nsation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately \\nexpected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures . Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, i f \\nnecessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ f rom those estimates. \\nThe fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”)  is equal to the market value of the Company’s \\ncommon stock on the date of the grant. These awards are subject  to time-based vesting which generally occurs over a \\nperiod of four years. \\nThe fair value of the Company’s stock options is estimated usin g the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, \\nwhich incorporates various assumptions including volatility, ex pected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is \\nbased on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stoc k over the most recent period commensurate with the \\nestimated expected life of the Company’s stock options. The exp ected life is based on historical experience and on the \\nterms and conditions of the stock options granted. The interest  rate assumption is based upon  observed Treasury yield \\ncurve rates appropriate for the expected life of the Company’s stock options. \\nIncome Taxes \\nThe Company’s provision for income tax comprises its current ta x liability and change in deferred tax assets and \\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized  for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences \\nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The measuremen t of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based \\non provisions of enacted tax law s; the effect of future changes  in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Valuation allowances  \\nare provided to reduce deferred t ax assets to an amount that in  management’s judgment is mo re likely than not to be \\nrecoverable against future taxable income. No U.S. taxes are pr ovided on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent \\nsuch earnings are deemed to be permanently invested. The Compan y’s income tax calculations are based on application \\nof applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign tax laws. The C ompany’s tax filings, however, are subject to audit by the \\nrespective tax authorities. Accordingly, the Company recognizes  tax liabilities based upon its estimate of whether, and the \\nextent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimat es are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain \\nincome tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. To the extent the final \\ntax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accru ed, the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax \\nexpense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehens ive Income (Loss). \\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share \\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net i ncome (loss) by weighted average number of common \\nshares outstanding for the period (excluding outstanding stock options and shares subject to repurchase). Diluted net \\nincome (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus \\nthe potential effect of dilutive securities which are convertib le into common shares (using the treasury stock method), \\nexcept in cases in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. Dil utive potential common shares  consist of incremental \\ncommon shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, upon ves ting of RSUs, contingently issuable shares for all periods \\nand assumed issuance of shares under the Company’s employee sto ck purchase plan. No dilutive potential common shares \\nare included in the computation of any diluted per share amount  when a loss from continuing operations was reported by \\nthe Company. \\nForeign Currency Translation \\nThe functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries i s the local currency for the respective subsidiary. The \\nassets and liabilities are translated at the period-end exchang e rate, and statements of comprehensive income (loss) are \\ntranslated at the average excha nge rate during the year. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are \\nincluded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). G ains and losses resulting from foreign currency \\ntransactions are included in the  Consolidated Statements of Com prehensive Income (Loss).

From time to time, the Company enters into foreign curre ncy forward contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign \\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency  denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company \\ndoes not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trad ing purposes. The Company records these forward contracts \\nat fair value. The counterparty to these foreign currency forwa rd contracts is a financial institution that the Company \\nbelieves is creditworthy, and therefore, we believe the credit risk of counterparty non-performance is not significant. These \\nforeign currency forward contracts are not designated for hedge  accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value \\nof these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component o f interest and other income (expense), net and offsets the \\nchange in fair value of the foreign currency denominated moneta ry assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in interest \\nand other income (expense), net. The duration of these forward contracts is usually three months.  \\nBusiness Combinations \\nThe Company allocates the fair va lue of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed \\nand intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair va lues at the date of the business combination. The excess of \\nthe fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values o f these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as \\ngoodwill. Such valuations require management to make significan t estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to \\nintangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain int angible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated \\nreplacement costs and future exp ected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, acquired patents, and \\ntrade names from a market partic ipant perspective, useful lives  and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value \\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which  are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a \\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of  purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities \\naffects the Company’s amortizati on expense, as acquired finite- lived intangible assets are amor tized over their useful life, \\nwhereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including in-pr ocess research and development, and goodwill, are not \\namortized but tested annually for  impairment. During the measur ement period, which is not to exceed one year from the \\nacquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets  acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding \\noffset to goodwill. Upon the conc lusion of the measurement peri od, any subsequent adjustment s are recorded to earnings. \\nLitigation \\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and  legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course \\nof business. The Company accrues for losses related to litigati on when a potential loss is probable and the loss can be \\nreasonably estimated in accordanc e with Financial Accounting St andards Board (“FASB”) requirements. See Note 6, \\n“Commitments and Contingencies”. \\nAccounting Standards Adopted \\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU ”) No. 2016  -  13, Financial Instruments – Credit \\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial I nstruments (“ASU No. 2016  -  13”), which requires \\nmeasurement and recognition of expected credit losses for finan cial assets held at the reporting date based on internal \\ninformation, external information, or a combination of both rel ating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and \\nsupportable forecasts.

REVENUE \\nThe Company derives revenue from two sources: Analytics revenue  and Integrated Yield Ramp revenue. \\nThe Company recognizes revenue i n accordance with FASB Accounti ng Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic \\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (co llectively known as “ASC 606”).  ASC \\n606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. \\nRevenue is recognized when control of products or services is t ransferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the \\nconsideration the Company exp ects to be entitled to in exchange  for those promised products or services. \\nThe Company determines revenue r ecognition through the followin g five steps: \\n• Identification of the contract, o r contracts, with a customer \\n• Identification of the performan ce obligations in the contract \\n• Determination of the transaction price \\n• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligati ons in the contract \\n• Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are  satisfied \\nThe Company accounts for a contr act when it has approval and co mmitment from both parties, t he rights of the parties \\nare identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is \\nprobable.

For contracts with multiple performance \\nobligations, the Company allocat es the transaction price of the  contract to each performance ob ligation on a relative basis \\nusing the standalone selling price (“SSP”). \\nAnalytics Revenue \\nAnalytics revenue is derived from the following primary offerin gs: licenses and services for standalone software \\n(which is primarily Exensio® and Cimetrix® products), SaaS (which is primarily Exensio products), and DFI ™ systems \\nand CV® systems (including Characteriza tion services) that do not incl ude performance incentives based on customers’ \\nyield achievement. \\nRevenue from standalone software is recognized depending on whe ther the license is perpetual or time-based. \\nPerpetual (one-time charge) licen se software is recognized at t he time of the inception of the arrangement when control \\ntransfers to the customers, if t he software license is consider ed as a separate performance obligation from the services \\noffered by the Company. Revenue from post-contract support is r ecognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis, \\nbecause we are providing (i) sup port and (ii) unspecified softw are updates on a when-and-if available basis over the \\ncontract term. Revenue from time-based-licensed software is all ocated to each performance obligation and is recognized \\neither at a point in time or over time as follows. The license component is recognized at the time when control transfers to \\ncustomers, with the post-contract support component recognized ratably over the committed term of the contract. For \\ncontracts with any combination of licenses, support, and other services, distinct performance obligations are accounted for \\nseparately. For contracts with multiple performance obligations , we allocate the transaction price of the contract to each \\nperformance obligation on a rela tive basis using the SSP attrib uted to each performance obligation. \\nRevenue from SaaS arrangements, which allow for the use of a cl oud-based software product or service over a \\ncontractually determined period o f time without the customer ha ving to take possession of software, is accounted for as a \\nsubscription and is recognized as revenue ratably, on a straigh t-line basis, over the subscription period beginning on the \\ndate the service is first made available to customers. For cont racts with any combination o f SaaS and related services, \\ndistinct performance obligations  are accounted for separately. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we \\nallocate the transaction price of the contract to each performa nce obligation on a relative ba sis using SSP attributed to each  \\nperformance obligation. \\nRevenue from DFI systems and CV systems (including Characteriza tion services) that do no t include performance \\nincentives based on customers’ y ield achievement is recognized primarily as services are performed. Where there are \\ndistinct performance obligations , the Company allocates revenue  to all deliverables based on their SSPs. For those \\ncontracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company al locates the transaction pri ce of the contract to each \\nperformance obligation on a relative basis using SSP attributed  to each performance obligation. Where there are not \\ndiscrete performance obligations, historically, revenue is prim arily recognized as services are performed using \\na percentage of completion method based on costs or labor-hours  inputs, whichever is the most appropriate measure of the \\nprogress towards completion of the contract. The estimation of percentage of completion method is complex and subject \\nto many variables that require significant judgement. Please re fer to “Significant Judgments” section of this Note for \\nfurther discussion. \\nThe Company also leases some of its DFI system and CV system as sets to some customers. The Company determines \\nthe existence of a lease when the customer controls the use of these identified assets for a period of time defined in the \\nlease agreement and classifies such leases as operating leases or sales-type leases. A lease is classified as a sales-type lea se \\nif it meets certain criteria under  Topic 842, Leases; otherwise  it is classified as an operating lease. Operating lease revenu e \\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Sal es-type lease revenue and corresponding lease receivables are \\nrecognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the future lease payments, and related interest income \\non lease receivable is recognized  o v e r  t h e  l e a s e  t e r m  a n d  a r e  r ecorded under Analytics Revenue in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Payments under sales -type leases are discounted using the interest rate \\nimplicit in the lease. When the Company’s leases are embedded i n contracts with customers that include non-lease ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 70}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n70 performance obligations, the Co mpany allocates consideration in  the contract between lease and non-lease components \\nbased on their relative SSPs. A ssets subject to operating lease s remain in Property and equipment and continue to be \\ndepreciated. Assets subject to sales-type leases are derecogniz ed from Property and equipmen t, net at lease commencement \\nand a net investment in the lease asset is recognized in Prepai d expenses and other current assets and Other non-current \\nassets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp Revenue \\nIntegrated Yield Ramp revenue is derived from the Company’s fix ed-fee engagements that include performance \\nincentives based on cust omers’ yield achievement (which consist s primarily of Gainshare r oyalties) typically based on \\ncustomer’s wafer shipments, pert aining to these fixed-price con tracts, which roya lties are variable. \\nRevenue under these project–based  contracts, which are delivere d over a specific period of time, typically for a fixed \\nfee component paid on a set sched ule, is recognized as services  are performed using a percentage of completion method \\nbased on costs or labor-inputs, whichever is the most appropria te measure of the progress towards completion of the \\ncontract. Where there are distin ct performance obligations, the  Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on \\ntheir SSPs and allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on  a relative basis using SSP. \\nSimilar to the services provided in connection with DFI systems  and CV systems that are contributing to Analytics revenue, \\ndue to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of percentage of completion method is \\ncomplex and subject to many variables that require significant judgement. Please refer to “Significant Judgments” section \\nof this Note for further discussion. \\nThe Gainshare royalty contained in Integrated Yield Ramp contra cts is a variable fee related to continued usage of the \\nCompany’s IP after the fixed-fee service period ends, based on a customer’s yield achievement. Revenue derived from \\nGainshare is contingent upon the Company’s customers reaching c ertain defined production yiel d levels. Gainshare royalty \\nperiods are generally subsequent to the delivery of all contrac tual services and performance  obligations. The Company \\nrecords Gainshare as a usage-bas ed royalty derived from custome rs’ usage of IP and records it in the same period in which \\nthe usage occurs. \\nDisaggregation of Revenue \\nThe Company disaggregates revenue  from contracts with customers  into the timing of the transfer of goods and \\nservices and the geographical regions. The Company determined t hat disaggregating revenue into these categories \\nachieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amo unt, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are \\naffected by econo mic factors. \\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied either over  time or at a point-in-time. The following table \\nrepresents a disaggregation of revenue by timing of revenue: \\n Year Ended December 31,  \\n    2023    2022  2021 \\nO v e r  t i m e  ....................................... 7 1%  6 9  %  6 5%\\nPoint- i n - t i m e  .................................... 2 9%  3 1  %  3 5%\\nT o t a l  ........................................... 1 0 0%  1 0 0  %  1 0 0%\\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 44%, 50% and  55% of total revenues for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectiv ely. See Note 11, “C ustomer and Geographic Information”. \\nSignificant Judgments \\nJudgments and estimates are required under ASC 606. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue \\nrecognition treatment required u nder ASC 606 for the Company’s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific \\nterms and may vary in some instances. ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 71}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n71 For revenue under project-based c ontracts for fixed-price imple mentation services, revenue i s recognized as services \\nare performed using a percentage -of-completion method based on costs or labor-hours input method, whichever is the \\nmost appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. Due to the nature of the work performed in \\nthese arrangements, the estimation of percentage of completion method is complex, subject to many variables and requires \\nsignificant judgment. Key factors reviewed by the Company to es timate costs to complete each c ontract are future labor \\nand product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. If ci rcumstances arise that chang e the original estimates of \\nrevenues, costs, or extent of progress toward completion, revis ions to the estimates are made. These revisions may result \\nin increases or decreases in estim ated revenues or costs, and s uch revisions are reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch-\\nup basis in the period in which the circumstances that gave ris e to the revision become known. \\nThe Company’s contracts with customers often include promises t o transfer products, licen ses software and provide \\nservices, including professional services, technical support se rvices, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. \\nDetermining whether licenses and services are distinct performa nce obligations that should be accounted for separately, \\nor not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires signi ficant judgment. The Company rarely licenses software on a \\nstandalone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the ra nge of SSPs for each performa nce obligation. In instances \\nwhere SSP is not directly observa ble because the Company does n ot license the software or sell the service separately, the \\nCompany determines the SSP using information that may include m arket conditions and other observable inputs. \\nThe Company is required to record Gainshare royalty revenue in the same period in which the usage occurs. Because \\nthe Company generally does not receive the acknowledgment repor ts from its customers during a given quarter within the \\ntime frame necessary to adequately  review the reports and inclu de the actual amounts in quarterly results for such quarter, \\nthe Company accrues the related revenue based on estimates of c ustomers underlying sales achievement. The Company’s \\nestimation process can be based on historical data, trends, sea sonality, changes in the contract rate, knowledge of the \\nchanges in the industry and changes in the customer’s manufactu ring environment learned through discussions with \\ncustomers and sales personnel. As a result of accruing revenue for the quarter based on such estimates, adjustments will \\nbe required in the following quarter to true-up revenue to the actual amounts reported. \\nContract Balances \\nThe Company performs its obligations under a contract with a cu stomer by licensing software or providing services \\nin exchange for consideration from the customer. The timing of the Company’s performance often differs from the timing \\nof the customer’s payment, which results in the recognition of a receivable, a contract asse t or a contract liability. \\nThe Company classifies the right to consideration in exchange f or software or services transferred to a customer as \\neither a receivable or a contract  asset. A receivable is a righ t to consideration that is unconditional, as compared to a \\ncontract asset, which is a right to consideration that is condi tional upon factors other than the passage of time. The majorit y \\nof the Company’s contract assets represent unbilled amounts rel ated to fixed-price service contracts when the revenue \\nrecognized exceeds the amount b illed to the customer. The contr act assets are generally classified as current and are \\nrecorded on a net basis with def erred revenue (i.e. contract li abilities) at the contract level . As of December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, contract assets of $6.8  million and $3.3 million, respect ively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current \\nassets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of D ecember 31, 2023 and 2022, contract assets of \\n$0.9 million and nil, respectively, are included in other non-c urrent assets in the accomp anying Consolidated Balance \\nSheets. The Company did not record any asset impairment charges  related to contract assets during fiscal years 2023, 2022 \\nand 2021. \\nDeferred revenues and billings in excess of recognized revenues  consist substantially of amounts invoiced in advance \\nof revenue recognition and are recognized as the revenue recogn ition criteria are met. Defe rred revenues that will be \\nrecognized during the succeeding twelve-month period are record ed as current deferred revenues and the remaining portion \\nis recorded in other non-current liabilities in the accompanyin g Consolidated Balance Sh eets. As of December 31, 2023 \\nand 2022, the non-current portion of deferred revenues included  in non-current liabilities was $1.8 million and $1.9 million, \\nrespectively. Revenue recognized  for the years ended December 3 1, 2023, 2022 and 2021, that was included in the deferred \\nrevenues and billings in excess of recognized revenues balances  at the beginning of each reporting period was $24.8 \\nmillion, $24.9 million and $16.9 million, respectively.

This amount does not include significant \\ncontracts to which the customer is not committed, future sales- based or usage-based royalty payments in exchange for a \\nlicense of IP, and future payments for performance obligations from on-demand arrangements. This amount is subject to \\nchange due to future revaluations of variable consideration, te rminations, other contract modifications, or currency \\nadjustments. The estimated timing of the recognition of remaini ng unsatisfied performance obligations is subject to change \\nand is affected by changes to the scope, change in timing of de livery of products and services , or contract modifications. \\nThe adjustment to revenue recogn ized in the years ended Decembe r 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 from performance \\nobligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous peri ods was an increase of $3.7 million, an increase of $0.4 millio n \\nand a decrease $0.4 million, respectively. These amounts primar ily represent changes in estimated percentage-of-\\ncompletion based contracts and changes in actual versus estimat ed Gainshare royalty. \\nCosts to obtain or fulfill a contract \\nThe Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain or fulf ill a contract with a customer, including direct sales \\ncommissions and related fees, when it expects to recover those costs. Amortization expense related to these capitalized \\ncosts is recognized over the period associated with the revenue  from which the cost was incu rred. Total capitalized direct \\nsales commission costs included in prepaid expenses and other c urrent assets in the accomp anying Consolidated Balance \\nSheets as of December 31, 2023 a nd 2022 was $2.0 million and $1 .7 million, respectively. Tot al capitalized direct sales \\ncommission costs included in other non-current assets in the ac companying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2.6 million and $2.1 million, r espectively. Amortization of these assets for each of \\nthe years ended December 31, 202 3, 2022 and 2021 was $2.1 milli on, $1.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. There \\nwas no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for  the periods presented. \\nPractical Expedients \\nThe Company does not adjust transaction price for the effects o f a significant financing component when the period \\nbetween the transfers of the promised good or service to the cu stomer and payment for that good or service by the customer \\nis expected to be one year or less. The Company assessed each o f its revenue generating arrangements in order to determine \\nwhether a significant financing co mponent exists, and determine d its contracts did not include a significant financing \\ncomponent for the years ended December 31, 2023,  2022 and 2021.

The Company also \\nindemnifies certain customers from third-party claims of IP inf ringement relating to the use of its products. Historically, \\ncosts related to these guarantees have not been significant. Th e Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential \\nimpact of these guarantees on its future results of operations.  \\nPurchase Obligations \\nThe Company has purchase obligations with certain suppliers for  the purchase of goods and services entered in the \\nordinary course of business. A s of December 31, 2023, total out standing purchase obligatio ns were $26.2 million, the \\nmajority of which are due within the next 2 years. \\nIndemnification of Officers and Directors \\nAs permitted by the Delaware general corporation law, the Compa ny has included a provision in its certificate of \\nincorporation to eliminate the personal liability of its office rs and directors for monetary d amages for breach or alleged \\nbreach of their fiduciary duties as officers or d irectors, othe r than in cases of  fraud or other willful misconduct. \\nIn addition, the Bylaws of the Company provide that the Company  is required to indemnify its officers and directors \\neven when indemnification would otherwise be discretionary, and  the Company is required to advance expenses to its \\nofficers and directors as incu rred in connection with proceedin gs against them for which they may be indemnified. The \\nCompany has entered into indemnification agreements with its of ficers and directors containing provisions that are in some \\nrespects broader than the specific indemnification provisions c ontained in the Delaware general corporation law. The \\nindemnification agreements require the Company to indemnify its  officers and directors against liabilities that may arise \\nby reason of their status or service as officers and directors other than for liabilities arisin g from willful misconduct of a  \\nculpable nature, to advance their expenses incurred as a result  of any proceeding against them  as to which they could be \\nindemnified, and to obtain directors’ and officers’ insurance i f available on reasonable terms. The Company has obtained \\ndirectors’ and officers’ liabili ty insurance in amounts compara ble to other companies of the Company’s size and in the \\nCompany’s industry. Since a maximum obligation of the Company i s not explicitly stated in the Company’s Bylaws or in \\nits indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and  circumstances that arise ou t of any future claims, the \\noverall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. \\nLitigation \\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and  legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course \\nof business. The Company accrues for losses related to litigati on when a potential loss is probable, and the loss can be \\nreasonably estimated in accordance with FASB requirements. As o f December 31, 2023, except as disclosed below, the \\nCompany was not party to any mate rial legal proceedings for whi ch a loss was probable or an amount was accrued. From \\ntime to time, the Company may enter into contingent fee arrange ments with external legal firms that may represent the \\nCompany in legal proceedings related to disputes. Contingent le gal fees are accrued by the Company when they are \\nprobable and reason ably estimable. \\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company initiated an arbitration proceeding  with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center \\nagainst SMIC New Technology Res earch & Development (Shanghai) C orporation (“SMIC”) due to SMIC’s failure to pay \\nfees due to the Company under a series of contracts. The Compan y seeks to recover the unpaid fees, a declaration requiring \\nSMIC to pay fees under the contracts in the future (or a lump s um payment to end the contract), and costs associated with \\nbringing the arbitration proceeding. SMIC denies liability and an arbitration hearing was held in February 2023. Final \\nwritten submissions were submitted by the parties at the end of  August 2023. A decision is currently expected in 2024.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company had the following stock-based  compensation plans: \\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans \\nIn July 2001, the Company’s stockholders initially approved the  2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was \\nsubsequently amended and restated in 2010 (as amended, the “201 0 Purchase Plan”) to extend the term of the plan through \\nMay 17, 2020. Under the 2010 Purchase Plan, eligible employees can contribute up to 10% of their compensation, as \\ndefined in the Purchase Plan, towards the purchase of shares of  PDF common stock at a price of 85% of the lower of the \\nfair market value at the beginning of the offering period or th e end of the purchase period. The 2010 Purchase Plan provided \\nfor twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month purc hase periods in each offering period. The 2010 Purchase \\nPlan expired on May 17, 2020. Existing offering periods under t he 2010 Plan continued throug h the applicable expiration \\ndate and the final offering period expired on January 31, 2022.  On June 15, 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved \\nthe 2021 Employee Stock Purchase  Plan, which has a ten-year ter m (the “2021 Purchase Plan” and, together with the 2010 \\nPurchase Plan, the “Employee Purchase Plans”). The terms of 202 1 Purchase Plan are substan tially similar to those of the \\n2010 Purchase Plan. A twenty-four-month offering period under t he 2021 Purchase Plan co mmenced on August 1, 2021. \\nThe Company estimated the fair va lue of purchase rights granted  under the Employee Purchase Plans during the period \\nusing the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the fo llowing weighted average assumptions, resulting in the \\nfollowing weighted average fair values: \\n 2021 Purchase Plan \\n Year Ended December 31,  \\n   2023    2022   2021    \\nE x p e c t e d  l i f e  ( i n  y e a r s )  ................................ 1 . 2 5  1 .25  1.25\\nVolatilit y ........................................... 4 3 . 6 6% 4 8 . 7 3  %     48.00 %  \\nRisk- f r e e  i n t e r e s t  r a t e  ................................. 5 . 1 5%  2 . 7 5 %    0.11 %  \\nExpected dividen d .................................... —  —  —\\nWeighted average fair value of purchase rights  \\ngranted durin g the perio d .............................. $ 1 5 . 7 1 $ 1 0 . 0 0    $  6 . 7 1\\n ', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\SURYA\\\\iNeuron\\\\7_End_2_End_GenAI\\\\llmops_tradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 78}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents \\n78 During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a total of 2 23,608 and 182,083 shares, respectively, were issued \\nunder the 2021 Purchase Plan, at a weighted-average purchase pr ice of $17.14 per share and $16.15 per share, respectively. \\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 a total of 5, 203 and 108,623 shares, respectively, were issued under \\nthe 2010 Purchase Plan, at a weighted-average purchase price of  $13.40 per share and $9.53 per share, respectively.

Under the 2011 Plan, the Company may award stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), stock \\ngrants or stock units covering shares of the Company’s common s tock to employees, directors, non-employee directors \\nand contractors. The aggregate number of shares reserved for aw ards under the 2011 Plan is 13.8 million shares, plus up \\nto 3.5 million shares previously issued under the 2001 Stock Pl an adopted by the Company in 2001, which expired in 2011 \\n(the “2001 Plan”) that are eith er (i) forfeited or (ii) repurch ased by the Company or are shares subject to awards previously \\nissued under the 2001 Plan that expire or that terminate withou t having been exercised or settled in full on or after \\nNovember 16, 2011. In case of awards other than options or SARs , the aggregate number of shares reserved under the \\n2011 Plan will be decreased at a rate of 1.33 shares issued pur suant to such awards. The exercise price for stock options \\nmust generally be at p rices no less than the fair market value at the date of grant. S tock options genera lly expire ten years \\nfrom the date of grant and become vested and exercisable over a  four-year period. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, 14.3 m illion shares of common stock we re reserved to cover stock-based awards under the \\n2011 Plan, of which 3.7 million shares were available for futur e grant. The number of shares reserved and available under \\nthe 2011 Plan includes 0.5 million shares that were subject to awards previously made under the 2001 Plan and were \\nforfeited, expired or repurchased by the Company after the adop tion of the 2011 Plan through December 31, 2023. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023, there were no outstanding awards that were g ranted outside of the 2011 or 2001 Plans (collectively, \\nthe “Stock Plans”). \\nThe Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option- pricing model, which incorporates various \\nassumptions including volatility, expected life, interest rate and expected dividend. The expected volatility is based on the \\nhistorical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the mo st recent period commensurate with the estimated \\nexpected life of the Company’s stock options. The expected life  of an award is based on historical experience and on the \\nterms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees. The interest rate assumptio n is based upon observed \\nTreasury yield curve rates approp riate for the expected life of  the Company’s s tock options. \\nNo stock options were granted during the years ended December 3 1, 2023, 2022 and 2021. \\nStock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based o n the award’s fair value and is recognized on a straight-\\nline basis over the vesting period s, generally four years. As s tock-based compensation expense recognized is based on \\nawards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for est imated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of \\ngrant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actua l forfeitures differ f rom those estimates.

As part of the system \\noffering, we provide test progr ams for each CV test chip that a re tuned to the customer’s process. This automated \\nsystem provides parallel functional testing, thus minimizing th e time required to perform millions of electrical \\nmeasurements to test our CV test chips. We provide services to analyze the unique, differentiated data output of \\nthis tester using the Exensio Characterization software to prov ide actionable insights to our customers. \\n• Exensio Characterization software – This module, which is designed to integrate seamlessly with the  rest of the \\nExensio software, collects the da ta generated from our CV test products, generating models of the performance \\neffects of process variations on these design building blocks. As part of the system offering, we also offer analysis \\nservices, if the customer elects not to do such analysis itself . \\nCimetrix® Software Products . Our Cimetrix software products enable equipment manufacturers  in the semiconductor \\nand electronics industries to provide standard interfaces on th eir products for efficient equi pment communication, control, \\nand data collection. Numerous industry standards have been esta blished for equipment connectivity and control, including \\nthe SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) defined SECS (SEMI Equipment Communication \\nStandard), GEM (Generic Equipment Model), GEM300, and EDA (equi pment data acquisition) standards. Our Cimetrix \\nproducts are designed to fully support these industry standards  to enable equipment manufacturers to implement robust, \\nturnkey support for these connectivity and control standards wi thout needing to invest engineering resources to develop \\ntheir own interfaces to these standards. Factories that purchas e manufacturing equipment enabled with Cimetrix-supported \\ninterfaces, benefit from consist ent and robust implementations of industry standards, enabling faster and more efficient \\nimplementation of smart manufacturing initiatives that depend o n the collection and analysis of manufacturing and product \\ndata. Cimetrix products are sold via perpetual licenses and typ ically sold as part of a softw are development kit (“SDK”) \\nthat helps equipment manufacturers implement them quickly. We c harge a one-time fee per equipment product type for \\nthe SDK license and a one-time fee for each piece of equipment shipped that includes the Cimetrix runtime license. \\n• Equipment Factory Connectivity – Our products for equipment factory connectivity primarily inclu de the \\nfollowing:  \\n\\uf0a7 Cimetrix CIMConnect ™ is a SEMI SECS/GEM interface to the factory host for automate d control and \\ndata collection. The Cimetrix CIMConnect module supports multip le-host interfaces simultaneously, \\nwhich allows customers to support legacy, custom, and GEM inter faces. Cimetrix CIMConnect is used \\nin semiconductor wafer fabrication, semiconductor back-end (tes t, assembly, and packaging), PV, HB-\\nLED, disk drive, flat panel displays, printed circuit boards an d other electronics manufacturing. In \\naddition to enabling the implementation of the SEMI SECS/GEM st andards E4, E5, E30, E37, E172, \\nand E173, Cimetrix CIMConnect also supports SEMI PV2 (PVECI), A 3 (PCBECI), and HB4 (HB-LED \\nECI) standards. \\n\\uf0a7 Cimetrix CIM300 ™ is a GEM interface for 300mm equipment using SEMI standards, including E39, \\nE40, E87, E90, E94, E116, E148, and E157. These SEMI standards allow for the full automation \\nrequired in manufacturing 300mm wafers. Cimetrix CIM300 manages  the interdependencies between \\nthe standards and simp lifies complex scenarios for easy impleme ntation of the standards. These \\nGEM300 standards are required for full automation in manufactur ing of 300mm wafers. Cimetrix '"
